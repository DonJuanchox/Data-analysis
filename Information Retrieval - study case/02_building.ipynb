López Errasquín E, Vázquez C<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A strain of Trichoderma atroviride, isolated from sewage sludge obtained from a water treatment plant located in Madrid (Spain), has been studied for tolerance to heavy metals (copper, zinc and cadmium) and for its capacities to uptake these metals. It was found that this fungus is capable of surviving high metal concentrations, apparently as a result of the natural selection of resistant cells. Also, growth and metal uptake have been assayed in samples where the fungus was cultured in the presence of a single metal and in the presence of a combination of two or three cations, where additive and synergistic interactions were observed. Finally, metal uptake by this strain has been studied under different nutritional conditions. It was found that the highest values of metals removal were achieved for autolysed mycelia while the lowest levels were observed in the presence of glucose.</em></small><br>[ID: 12656239]"

Prieto-Recio C, Romeralo C, Bezos D, Martín-García J, Martínez-Álvarez P, Botella L, Diez JJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. (=Fomes annosus (Fr.) Cooke), one of the most important pathogens in coniferous forests in Europe, Asia, and North America, causes root and butt rot. H. annosum was first recorded on Pinus pinaster Ait. (commonly known as Maritime pine) in France and Great Britain in 1961 (4) and Portugal in 1986 (2). P. pinaster is the most widespread conifer in Spain, with more than 700,000 and 600,000 ha in pure and mixed stands, respectively. Over the last few years, P. pinaster decline was observed in several stands in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. Unusual crown transparency, small needles, foliage discoloration, and early tree death are characteristic decline symptoms associated with the high mortality rate on this species. In June of 2010, 11 trees (40 to 60 years old) with a different degree of decline were felled in two zones (42°2'41″N, 3°18'14″W, elevation 1,096 m and 41°55'40″N, 3°12'3″W, elevation 1,128 m) and cut into sections (stump height, breast height, and near the top). Wood slices were removed from each section and taken to the laboratory. Samples were placed in moist chambers with optimal conditions of humidity and temperature to enhance pathogen growth. After 20 days of incubation in darkness at 25°C, H. annosum (anamorph Spiniger meineckellum [A. Olson] Stalpers) occurred on most of these slices. Conidiophores with subglobose to pyriform conidia (5.8 × 4.2 μm) were observed with a compound microscope. The fungus was isolated to extract DNA by disruption of the mycelium followed by washes with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol solution (25:24:1). DNA was precipitated with 20% polyethylene glycol solution. PCR was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer of Dynazyme II DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Ltd, Espoo, Finland) with ITS primers, 1F (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3') and 4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). After DNA purification, samples were sequenced (SECUGEN, Madrid, Spain) and aligned and corrected with Geneious Pro 5.3 to obtain the consensus sequences. Resulting DNA sequences of two isolates were deposited in GenBank (Nos. FR850494 and FR850495), and compared with a Blastn search at GenBank showing 100% identity and 100% coverage with H. annosum sensu stricto, former ISG-P (intersterility group of pines). For pathogenicity tests, 10 seedlings (2 year old) were inoculated with autoclaved P. pinaster wood chips colonized by H. annosum, and 10 control seedlings were inoculated with noncolonized wood chips. Inoculums were prepared by growing H. annosum on 4-mm-diameter wood chips placed on potato dextrose agar media for 3 weeks. The wood chips were put inside an oblique incision made at 6 cm above the soil line and wrapped with Parafilm. After 8 weeks in a growth chamber at 22.5°C with a 14-h photoperiod, the inoculated seedlings showed typical symptoms and 3 seedlings of 10 were dead. H. annosum was previously recorded on P. sylvestris in central Spain (1), causing needle drop, swelling at the stump height, and presence of dead trees by circular areas. This pathogen was also reported on P. nigra in northeastern Spain, associated with defoliation and mortality (3). To our knowledge, this is the first record of H. annosum on P. pinaster in Spain.

Of the compounds synthesized the five indane-2-acid derivatives 5-acetylindane-2-carboxylic acid (2), (+/-)5-formylindane-2-carboxylic acid (3), (+/-)indane-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (4), (+/-)formyl-2-methylindane-2-carboxylic acid (7) and 5-acetyl-indane-2,2-dicarboxylic acid (10) and 4-(2'-ethylbutyloxy)benzaldehyde (18) have not yet been described. Different biological test systems were employed to investigate the antibiotic activities of the synthesized analogues. The experimental results suggest that in the case of fomajorin S, the structural element essential for its toxicity is the 2-H- or 2-methylindane 2-acid. From the results obtained with the synthetic analogues of fomannoxin, it is now evident that the toxicity of this fungal metabolite can be attributed to an aromatic ring with a carbonyl or carboxyl substituent combined with a branched lipophilic side chain in p-substitution.</em></small><br>[ID: 8292264]"

From five of the fruit bodies containing dsRNA basidiospores were investigated and 10-84% of the germinated basidiospores contained dsRNA. On high nutrient media, the germination frequency of basidiospores was reduced by presence of dsRNA in the fruit body (P < 0.05); germination frequencies were 34 and 78% for spores from fruit bodies with and without dsRNA, respectively. The same trend was present also on low nutrient media, although not statistically significant; germination was 3 and 10% for spores from infected and dsRNA free fruit bodies, respectively. Transmission of dsRNA in H. annosum from mycelia into basidiospores together with the lowered germination frequency are likely to play a significant role in the life cycle of the fungus.

Raffaello T, Keriö S, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. s.l. is a filamentous white rot fungus, considered to be the most economically important pathogen of conifer trees. Despite the severity of the tree infection, very little is known about the molecular and biochemical aspects related to adaptation to abiotic stresses. In this study, the osmotic and oxidative tolerance as well as the role of the HaHOG1 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) gene were investigated. The transcript levels of the yeast orthologues GPD1, HSP78, STL1, GRE2 and the ATPase pumps ENA1, PMR1, PMC1 known to have an important role in osmotolerance were also quantified under salt osmotic conditions. The HaHOG1 gene was used for a heterologous expression and functional study in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Δhog1 strain. Moreover, the phosphorylation level of HaHog1p was studied under salt osmotic and oxidative stress. The result showed that H. annosum displayed a decreased growth when exposed to an increased concentration of osmotic and oxidative stressors. GPD1, HSP78, STL1 and GRE2 showed an induction already at 10 min after exposure to salt stress. Among the ATPase pumps studied, PMC1 was highly induced when the fungus was exposed to 0.2 M CaCl₂ for 60 min. The heterologous expression of the HaHOG1 sequence in yeast confirmed that the gene is able to restore the osmotolerance and oxidative tolerance in the S. cerevisiae hog1Δ mutant strain. The HaHog1p was strongly phosphorylated in the presence of NaCl, KCl, H₂O₂ but not in the presence of CaCl₂ and MgCl₂. The GFP-HaHog1p fusion protein accumulated in the nuclei of the S. cerevisiae hog1Δ cells when exposed to high osmotic conditions but not under oxidative stress. These results provide the first insights about the response of H. annosum to osmotic and oxidative stress and elucidate the role of the HaHOG1 gene in such conditions.</em></small><br>[ID: 22319614]"

Raffaello T, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum is the causative agent of butt and root rot disease of conifer trees and it's one of the most destructive conifer pathogen in the northern hemisphere. Because of the intrinsic difficulties in genome manipulation in this fungus, most studies have been focused on gene expression analysis using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR is a powerful technique but its reliability resides in the correct selection of a set of reference genes used in the data normalization. In this study, we determined the expression stability of 11 selected reference genes in H. annosum. Almost nothing has so far been published about validation of a set of reference genes to be used in gene expression experiments in this fungus. Eleven reference genes were validated in H. annosum which was grown on three different substrates: pine bark, pine heartwood, and pine sapwood. Bestkeeper and NormFinder Excel-based software were used to evaluate the reference gene transcripts' stability. The results from these two programs indicated that three reference genes namely Tryp metab, RNA Pol3 TF, and Actin were stable in H. annosum in the conditions studied. Interestingly, the GAPDH transcript which has been extensively used in qPCR data normalization is not the best choice when a wide reference gene selection is available. This work represents the first extensive validation of reference genes in H. annosum providing support for gene expression studies and benefits for the wider forest pathology community.</em></small><br>[ID: 23645035]"

Mushroom mating type loci (MAT) encode for dozens or hundreds of incompatibility alleles whose loss from the population is greatly restricted through negative frequency selection, leading to a system of alleles with highly divergent sequences. Here, we use DNA sequences of homeodomain (HD) encoding genes at the MAT locus of five closely related species of the root rot basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato to show that the extended coalescence time of MAT alleles greatly predates speciation in the group, contrasting loci outside of MAT that show allele divergences largely consistent with the species phylogeny with those of MAT, which show rampant trans-species polymorphism. We observe a roughly 6-fold greater genealogical depth and polymorphism of MAT compared with non-MAT that argues for the maintenance of balanced polymorphism for a minimum duration of 24 My based on a molecular-clock calibrated species phylogeny. As with other basidiomycete HD genes, balancing selection appears to be concentrated at the specificity-determining region in the N-terminus of the protein based on identification of codons under selection and the absence of recombination within the region. However, the elevated polymorphism extends into the nonspecificity determining regions as well as a neighboring non-MAT gene, the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP). In doing so, increased divergence should decrease recombination among alleles and as a by-product create incompatibilities in the functional domains not involved in allele recognition but in regulating sexual development. </em></small><br>[ID: 23864721]"

A previous genetic study indicated that the resistance of Norway spruce (Picea abies) to Heterobasidion annosum s.l., a pathogenic basidiomycete species complex, is linked to a quantitative trait loci that associates with differences in fungal growth in sapwood (FGS) that includes a gene, PaLAR3, which encodes a leucoanthocyanidin reductase. In this study, gene sequences showed the presence of two PaLAR3 allelic lineages in P. abies. Higher resistance was associated with the novel allele, which was found in low frequency in the four P. abies populations that we studied. Norway spruce plants carrying at least one copy of the novel allele showed a significant reduction in FGS after inoculation with Heterobasidion parviporum compared to their half-siblings carrying no copies, indicating dominance of this allele. The amount of (+) catechin, the enzymatic product of PaLAR3, was significantly higher in bark of trees homozygous for the novel allele. Although we observed that the in vitro activities of the enzymes encoded by the two alleles were similar, we could show that allele-specific transcript levels were significantly higher for the novel allele, indicating that regulation of gene expression is responsible for the observed effects in resistance, possibly caused by differences in cis-acting elements that we observe in the promoter region of the two alleles.</em></small><br>[ID: 27317690]"

HaSSP30 also increased the transcription of host-defence-related genes in N. benthamiana, which suggested a necrotrophic-specific immune response.

Prieto-Recio C, Romeralo C, Bezos D, Martín-García J, Martínez-Álvarez P, Botella L, Diez JJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. (=Fomes annosus (Fr.) Cooke), one of the most important pathogens in coniferous forests in Europe, Asia, and North America, causes root and butt rot. H. annosum was first recorded on Pinus pinaster Ait. (commonly known as Maritime pine) in France and Great Britain in 1961 (4) and Portugal in 1986 (2). P. pinaster is the most widespread conifer in Spain, with more than 700,000 and 600,000 ha in pure and mixed stands, respectively. Over the last few years, P. pinaster decline was observed in several stands in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. Unusual crown transparency, small needles, foliage discoloration, and early tree death are characteristic decline symptoms associated with the high mortality rate on this species. In June of 2010, 11 trees (40 to 60 years old) with a different degree of decline were felled in two zones (42°2'41″N, 3°18'14″W, elevation 1,096 m and 41°55'40″N, 3°12'3″W, elevation 1,128 m) and cut into sections (stump height, breast height, and near the top). Wood slices were removed from each section and taken to the laboratory. Samples were placed in moist chambers with optimal conditions of humidity and temperature to enhance pathogen growth. After 20 days of incubation in darkness at 25°C, H. annosum (anamorph Spiniger meineckellum [A. Olson] Stalpers) occurred on most of these slices. Conidiophores with subglobose to pyriform conidia (5.8 × 4.2 μm) were observed with a compound microscope. The fungus was isolated to extract DNA by disruption of the mycelium followed by washes with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol solution (25:24:1). DNA was precipitated with 20% polyethylene glycol solution. PCR was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer of Dynazyme II DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Ltd, Espoo, Finland) with ITS primers, 1F (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3') and 4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). After DNA purification, samples were sequenced (SECUGEN, Madrid, Spain) and aligned and corrected with Geneious Pro 5.3 to obtain the consensus sequences. Resulting DNA sequences of two isolates were deposited in GenBank (Nos. FR850494 and FR850495), and compared with a Blastn search at GenBank showing 100% identity and 100% coverage with H. annosum sensu stricto, former ISG-P (intersterility group of pines). For pathogenicity tests, 10 seedlings (2 year old) were inoculated with autoclaved P. pinaster wood chips colonized by H. annosum, and 10 control seedlings were inoculated with noncolonized wood chips. Inoculums were prepared by growing H. annosum on 4-mm-diameter wood chips placed on potato dextrose agar media for 3 weeks. The wood chips were put inside an oblique incision made at 6 cm above the soil line and wrapped with Parafilm. After 8 weeks in a growth chamber at 22.5°C with a 14-h photoperiod, the inoculated seedlings showed typical symptoms and 3 seedlings of 10 were dead. H. annosum was previously recorded on P. sylvestris in central Spain (1), causing needle drop, swelling at the stump height, and presence of dead trees by circular areas. This pathogen was also reported on P. nigra in northeastern Spain, associated with defoliation and mortality (3). To our knowledge, this is the first record of H. annosum on P. pinaster in Spain.

Garbelotto M, Chapela I<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.:Fr.) Bref. is a pathogen of conifers in the Northern Hemisphere. This fungus has been previously reported from Pinus spp. (1) and from Abies religiosa (H.B.K.) Schl. et Cham. (2) in Central Mexico. In 1998, H. annosum was collected for the first time from stumps of Abies hickeli Flous et Gaussen in the Southern Mexican State of Oaxaca, at an altitude of 2,900 m (Lat 17° 28' N, Long 96° 31' W). Although standing trees at the sampled site were asymptomatic, the sapwood and heartwood of several fir stumps were extensively decayed. The white laminated rot was similar to that caused by H. annosum on other Abies spp. Decay pockets extended to the upper surface of the stumps, indicating the fungus had infected and colonized the tree butts prior to tree felling. H. annosum basidiocarps were found both outside the roots in the duff layer and inside the decay pockets. The anamorph of H. annosum (Spiniger meineckellum (A. Olson) Stalpers) was isolated from the context of three basidiocarps. Based on comparative analysis of DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region, all three isolates belonged to the North American S intersterility group (ISG). This report expands the host and the geographic ranges of the North American S ISG, and represents the world's southernmost finding of an Abies species infected by this pathogen. References: (1) R.

Sonnenbichler J, Dietrich J, Schäfer W, Zetl I<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A series of synthetic analogues of fomannoxin and fomajorin S, the toxic metabolites of the basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum, was prepared in order to investigate which partial structures of the molecules are responsible for their biological activities. Of the compounds synthesized the five indane-2-acid derivatives 5-acetylindane-2-carboxylic acid (2), (+/-)5-formylindane-2-carboxylic acid (3), (+/-)indane-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (4), (+/-)formyl-2-methylindane-2-carboxylic acid (7) and 5-acetyl-indane-2,2-dicarboxylic acid (10) and 4-(2'-ethylbutyloxy)benzaldehyde (18) have not yet been described. Different biological test systems were employed to investigate the antibiotic activities of the synthesized analogues. The experimental results suggest that in the case of fomajorin S, the structural element essential for its toxicity is the 2-H- or 2-methylindane 2-acid. From the results obtained with the synthetic analogues of fomannoxin, it is now evident that the toxicity of this fungal metabolite can be attributed to an aromatic ring with a carbonyl or carboxyl substituent combined with a branched lipophilic side chain in p-substitution.</em></small><br>[ID: 8292264]"

Of these isolates, 47 were tissue isolates from fruit bodies and 59 were isolated from decayed wood. Nucleic acids were extracted from freeze-dried mycelia and dsRNA was separated by cellulose CF-11 chromatography and confirmed by digestions with specific nucleases. dsRNA was present in 19 and 14% of the tissue and wood isolates, respectively. From five of the fruit bodies containing dsRNA basidiospores were investigated and 10-84% of the germinated basidiospores contained dsRNA. On high nutrient media, the germination frequency of basidiospores was reduced by presence of dsRNA in the fruit body (P < 0.05); germination frequencies were 34 and 78% for spores from fruit bodies with and without dsRNA, respectively. The same trend was present also on low nutrient media, although not statistically significant; germination was 3 and 10% for spores from infected and dsRNA free fruit bodies, respectively. Transmission of dsRNA in H. annosum from mycelia into basidiospores together with the lowered germination frequency are likely to play a significant role in the life cycle of the fungus. The relative importance of different transmission routes for dsRNA in H. annosum is discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 15119351]"

James TY, Stenlid J, Olson A, Johannesson H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Many fungi have heterokaryotic life stages in which genetically different nuclei inhabit the same cell. In basidiomycetes, the heterokaryon is the product of mating and represents a genomic union very similar to a diploid thallus, yet the maintenance of unfused nuclei suggests a more complex association of the two genomes relative to diploidy. In species with variable numbers of nuclei per heterokaryotic cell, nuclear ratios within a mycelium may possibly become imbalanced (differ from 1:1) due to nuclear competition. In this study, heterokaryons of the basidiomycete Heterobasidion parviporum were examined to determine the effects of genotype and environment on nuclear ratios within vegetative mycelia. The data reveal that nuclear ratios are frequently imbalanced, generally stable over time, and genetically determined. The nuclear ratios were affected by environment, but the observed nuclear ratios did not follow the expectations of strong selection acting on a population of nuclei. Instead, these ratios were largely driven by genetic effects and epigenetic effects. Finally, the data suggest that nuclear ratio imbalance also affects both gene transcription and growth rate, implying that heterokaryotic basidiomycetes are not functionally equivalent to diploid individuals and have a higher potential for genotypic and phenotypic variation.</em></small><br>[ID: 18637961]"

Raffaello T, Keriö S, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. s.l. is a filamentous white rot fungus, considered to be the most economically important pathogen of conifer trees. Despite the severity of the tree infection, very little is known about the molecular and biochemical aspects related to adaptation to abiotic stresses. In this study, the osmotic and oxidative tolerance as well as the role of the HaHOG1 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) gene were investigated. The transcript levels of the yeast orthologues GPD1, HSP78, STL1, GRE2 and the ATPase pumps ENA1, PMR1, PMC1 known to have an important role in osmotolerance were also quantified under salt osmotic conditions. The HaHOG1 gene was used for a heterologous expression and functional study in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Δhog1 strain. Moreover, the phosphorylation level of HaHog1p was studied under salt osmotic and oxidative stress. The result showed that H. annosum displayed a decreased growth when exposed to an increased concentration of osmotic and oxidative stressors. GPD1, HSP78, STL1 and GRE2 showed an induction already at 10 min after exposure to salt stress. Among the ATPase pumps studied, PMC1 was highly induced when the fungus was exposed to 0.2 M CaCl₂ for 60 min. The heterologous expression of the HaHOG1 sequence in yeast confirmed that the gene is able to restore the osmotolerance and oxidative tolerance in the S. cerevisiae hog1Δ mutant strain. The HaHog1p was strongly phosphorylated in the presence of NaCl, KCl, H₂O₂ but not in the presence of CaCl₂ and MgCl₂. The GFP-HaHog1p fusion protein accumulated in the nuclei of the S. cerevisiae hog1Δ cells when exposed to high osmotic conditions but not under oxidative stress. These results provide the first insights about the response of H. annosum to osmotic and oxidative stress and elucidate the role of the HaHOG1 gene in such conditions.</em></small><br>[ID: 22319614]"

Because of the intrinsic difficulties in genome manipulation in this fungus, most studies have been focused on gene expression analysis using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR is a powerful technique but its reliability resides in the correct selection of a set of reference genes used in the data normalization. In this study, we determined the expression stability of 11 selected reference genes in H. annosum. Almost nothing has so far been published about validation of a set of reference genes to be used in gene expression experiments in this fungus. Eleven reference genes were validated in H. annosum which was grown on three different substrates: pine bark, pine heartwood, and pine sapwood. Bestkeeper and NormFinder Excel-based software were used to evaluate the reference gene transcripts' stability. The results from these two programs indicated that three reference genes namely Tryp metab, RNA Pol3 TF, and Actin were stable in H. annosum in the conditions studied. Interestingly, the GAPDH transcript which has been extensively used in qPCR data normalization is not the best choice when a wide reference gene selection is available. This work represents the first extensive validation of reference genes in H. annosum providing support for gene expression studies and benefits for the wider forest pathology community.</em></small><br>[ID: 23645035]"

Mushroom mating type loci (MAT) encode for dozens or hundreds of incompatibility alleles whose loss from the population is greatly restricted through negative frequency selection, leading to a system of alleles with highly divergent sequences. Here, we use DNA sequences of homeodomain (HD) encoding genes at the MAT locus of five closely related species of the root rot basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato to show that the extended coalescence time of MAT alleles greatly predates speciation in the group, contrasting loci outside of MAT that show allele divergences largely consistent with the species phylogeny with those of MAT, which show rampant trans-species polymorphism. We observe a roughly 6-fold greater genealogical depth and polymorphism of MAT compared with non-MAT that argues for the maintenance of balanced polymorphism for a minimum duration of 24 My based on a molecular-clock calibrated species phylogeny. As with other basidiomycete HD genes, balancing selection appears to be concentrated at the specificity-determining region in the N-terminus of the protein based on identification of codons under selection and the absence of recombination within the region. However, the elevated polymorphism extends into the nonspecificity determining regions as well as a neighboring non-MAT gene, the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP). In doing so, increased divergence should decrease recombination among alleles and as a by-product create incompatibilities in the functional domains not involved in allele recognition but in regulating sexual development. </em></small><br>[ID: 23864721]"

Nemesio-Gorriz M, Hammerbacher A, Ihrmark K, Källman T, Olson Å, Lascoux M, Stenlid J, Gershenzon J, Elfstrand M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Despite the fact that fungal diseases are a growing menace for conifers in modern silviculture, only a very limited number of molecular markers for pathogen resistance have been validated in conifer species. A previous genetic study indicated that the resistance of Norway spruce (Picea abies) to Heterobasidion annosum s.l., a pathogenic basidiomycete species complex, is linked to a quantitative trait loci that associates with differences in fungal growth in sapwood (FGS) that includes a gene, PaLAR3, which encodes a leucoanthocyanidin reductase. In this study, gene sequences showed the presence of two PaLAR3 allelic lineages in P. abies. Higher resistance was associated with the novel allele, which was found in low frequency in the four P. abies populations that we studied. Norway spruce plants carrying at least one copy of the novel allele showed a significant reduction in FGS after inoculation with Heterobasidion parviporum compared to their half-siblings carrying no copies, indicating dominance of this allele. The amount of (+) catechin, the enzymatic product of PaLAR3, was significantly higher in bark of trees homozygous for the novel allele. Although we observed that the in vitro activities of the enzymes encoded by the two alleles were similar, we could show that allele-specific transcript levels were significantly higher for the novel allele, indicating that regulation of gene expression is responsible for the observed effects in resistance, possibly caused by differences in cis-acting elements that we observe in the promoter region of the two alleles.</em></small><br>[ID: 27317690]"

Raffaello T, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered to be one of the most destructive conifer pathogens in the temperate forests of the northern hemisphere. H. annosum is characterized by a dual fungal lifestyle. The fungus grows necrotrophically on living plant cells and saprotrophically on dead wood material. In this study, we screened the H. annosum genome for small secreted proteins (HaSSPs) that could potentially be involved in promoting necrotrophic growth during the fungal infection process. The final list included 58 HaSSPs that lacked predictable protein domains. The transient expression of HaSSP encoding genes revealed the ability of 8 HaSSPs to induce cell chlorosis and cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. In particular, one protein (HaSSP30) could induce a rapid, strong, and consistent cell death within 2 days post-infiltration. HaSSP30 also increased the transcription of host-defence-related genes in N. benthamiana, which suggested a necrotrophic-specific immune response. This is the first line of evidence demonstrating that the H. annosum genome encodes HaSSPs with the capability to induce plant cell death in a non-host plant.</em></small><br>[ID: 28801666]"

Prieto-Recio C, Romeralo C, Bezos D, Martín-García J, Martínez-Álvarez P, Botella L, Diez JJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. (=Fomes annosus (Fr.) Cooke), one of the most important pathogens in coniferous forests in Europe, Asia, and North America, causes root and butt rot. H. annosum was first recorded on Pinus pinaster Ait. (commonly known as Maritime pine) in France and Great Britain in 1961 (4) and Portugal in 1986 (2). P. pinaster is the most widespread conifer in Spain, with more than 700,000 and 600,000 ha in pure and mixed stands, respectively. Over the last few years, P. pinaster decline was observed in several stands in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. Unusual crown transparency, small needles, foliage discoloration, and early tree death are characteristic decline symptoms associated with the high mortality rate on this species. In June of 2010, 11 trees (40 to 60 years old) with a different degree of decline were felled in two zones (42°2'41″N, 3°18'14″W, elevation 1,096 m and 41°55'40″N, 3°12'3″W, elevation 1,128 m) and cut into sections (stump height, breast height, and near the top). Wood slices were removed from each section and taken to the laboratory. Samples were placed in moist chambers with optimal conditions of humidity and temperature to enhance pathogen growth. After 20 days of incubation in darkness at 25°C, H. annosum (anamorph Spiniger meineckellum [A. Olson] Stalpers) occurred on most of these slices. Conidiophores with subglobose to pyriform conidia (5.8 × 4.2 μm) were observed with a compound microscope. The fungus was isolated to extract DNA by disruption of the mycelium followed by washes with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol solution (25:24:1). DNA was precipitated with 20% polyethylene glycol solution. PCR was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer of Dynazyme II DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Ltd, Espoo, Finland) with ITS primers, 1F (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3') and 4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). After DNA purification, samples were sequenced (SECUGEN, Madrid, Spain) and aligned and corrected with Geneious Pro 5.3 to obtain the consensus sequences. Resulting DNA sequences of two isolates were deposited in GenBank (Nos. FR850494 and FR850495), and compared with a Blastn search at GenBank showing 100% identity and 100% coverage with H. annosum sensu stricto, former ISG-P (intersterility group of pines). For pathogenicity tests, 10 seedlings (2 year old) were inoculated with autoclaved P. pinaster wood chips colonized by H. annosum, and 10 control seedlings were inoculated with noncolonized wood chips. Inoculums were prepared by growing H. annosum on 4-mm-diameter wood chips placed on potato dextrose agar media for 3 weeks. The wood chips were put inside an oblique incision made at 6 cm above the soil line and wrapped with Parafilm. After 8 weeks in a growth chamber at 22.5°C with a 14-h photoperiod, the inoculated seedlings showed typical symptoms and 3 seedlings of 10 were dead. H. annosum was previously recorded on P. sylvestris in central Spain (1), causing needle drop, swelling at the stump height, and presence of dead trees by circular areas. This pathogen was also reported on P. nigra in northeastern Spain, associated with defoliation and mortality (3). To our knowledge, this is the first record of H. annosum on P. pinaster in Spain.

Garbelotto M, Chapela I<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.:Fr.) Bref. is a pathogen of conifers in the Northern Hemisphere. This fungus has been previously reported from Pinus spp. (1) and from Abies religiosa (H.B.K.) Schl. et Cham. (2) in Central Mexico. In 1998, H. annosum was collected for the first time from stumps of Abies hickeli Flous et Gaussen in the Southern Mexican State of Oaxaca, at an altitude of 2,900 m (Lat 17° 28' N, Long 96° 31' W). Although standing trees at the sampled site were asymptomatic, the sapwood and heartwood of several fir stumps were extensively decayed. The white laminated rot was similar to that caused by H. annosum on other Abies spp. Decay pockets extended to the upper surface of the stumps, indicating the fungus had infected and colonized the tree butts prior to tree felling. H. annosum basidiocarps were found both outside the roots in the duff layer and inside the decay pockets. The anamorph of H. annosum (Spiniger meineckellum (A. Olson) Stalpers) was isolated from the context of three basidiocarps. Based on comparative analysis of DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region, all three isolates belonged to the North American S intersterility group (ISG). This report expands the host and the geographic ranges of the North American S ISG, and represents the world's southernmost finding of an Abies species infected by this pathogen. References: (1) R.

Al-Gharawi A, Moore D<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Kinetic analyses done with cell-free extracts of this basidiomycete fungus showed that the NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase exhibited positively co-operative interactions with the substrates 2-oxoglutarate and NADPH, negatively co-operative kinetics with NADP+ and was extremely sensitive to inhibition of deamination activity by ammonium and/or ammonia. The NAD-linked enzyme showed positive co-operativity with NADH, Michaelis-Menten kinetics with all other substrates and was subject only to mild inhibitions by the reaction products. Considered together with the values of the Michaelis constants, these results indicate that the former enzyme is primarily concerned with the amination of 2-oxoglutarate when the concentration of this substrate exceeds about 4 mM, while the NAD-linked enzyme is able to aminate or deaminate as metabolic conditions require. Synthesis of both enzymes was repressed by addition of carbamyl phosphate or N-acetyl-glutamate to mycelial cultures growing in media containing glucose and ammonium as carbon and nitrogen sources. Growth in media containing urea results in repression of the NADP-linked glutamate dehydrogenase and derepression of the NAD-linked enzyme. Such results indicate a connexion between the glutamate dehydrogenases and the urea cycle. It is suggested that under normal conditions of growth on complex media nitrogen is assimilated in the form of amino acids and that the glutamate dehydrogenases act in support of transaminases to allow this process to continue, and in support of the urea cycle to allow the disposal of excess nitrogen.</em></small><br>[ID: 13862]"

Heath IB, Heath MC<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Aspects of the ultrastructure of mitotic nuclei of the fungus Uromyces phaseoli var. vignae are described from both intercellular hyphae in the cowpea host and infection structures induced to differentiate in vitro. The interphase nucleus-associated organelle (NAO) consists of two trilamellar acircular disks connceted by an osmiophilic bar. The intranuclear spindle develops between these disks when they separate. The spindle contains pole to pole, interdigitating, chromosomal, and fragmentary microtubules arranged to form a central bundle along the surface of which lie the metaphase chromosomes. No metaphase plate is found. There are up to three microtubules per kinetochore and approximately 14 chromosomes on the haploid spindle. Telophase elongation appears to involve extension of pole to pole microtubules with no evidence for the remaining presence of interdigitating microtubules. Concomitantly, numerous cytoplasmic microtubules develop from each NAO disk where few or none are present in other phases. Reformation of the interphase NAO involves the formation of a sausage-shaped intermediate at late telophase. The nuclear envelope remains intact and the nucleolus persists throughtout division. Various aspects of the spindle and NAOs appear to be evolutionary intermediates between Ascomycetes and higher Basidiomycetes, thus supporting the theory of Basidiomycete evolution from the former group and demonstrating an encouraging correlation between mitotic characteristics and other phylogenetic markers.</em></small><br>[ID: 956269]"

All transformants retained their ability to form mycorrhizae with the habitual host plant Pinus pinaster, making them suitable for future physiological studies.</em></small><br>[ID: 1319284]"

Stankis MM, Specht CA, Yang H, Giasson L, Ullrich RC, Novotny CP<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The A alpha mating locus is one of four multiallelic loci that govern sexual development in the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune. We have determined the nucleotide sequence encoding three A alpha mating types, A alpha 1, A alpha 3, and A alpha 4. We have found that the locus for A alpha 3 and A alpha 4 consists of two genes: Y and Z. The locus for A alpha 1 encodes only one gene, Y. The Z polypeptides encoded by different alleles exhibit 42% identity. The Y polypeptides exhibit 49-54% identity. The finding that the deduced Z and Y polypeptides have homeodomain motifs suggests that these polypeptides may be DNA-binding regulatory proteins that control the expression of developmental genes. The deduced Z polypeptide also has acidic regions that might be functionally analogous to the acidic regions in yeast GAL4 and GCN4 that activate transcription. The Y polypeptide has a serine-rich region and a basic region that shows some identity to the lysine-rich region of H1 histones.</em></small><br>[ID: 1353886]"

Zolan ME, Crittenden JR, Heyler NK, Seitz LC<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We have constructed cosmid libraries from electrophoretically separated chromosomes of the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus. These libraries greatly facilitate the isolation of genes by complementation of mutant phenotypes and are particularly useful for map-based cloning strategies. From a library constructed from two co-migrating C.cinereus chromosomes, we isolated a clone that complements the C.cinereus rad9-1 mutation. Examination of this clone showed that it complements both the repair and meiotic defects of this mutant. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping using a portion of this clone showed that it maps to the rad9 locus. In addition, a single copy of transforming DNA is sufficient to complement the rad9-1 defects. Thus, we believe we have cloned the rad9 gene itself. We also used a chromosome-specific library and backcrossed isolates to rapidly identify a cosmid clone which is tightly linked to the rad11 locus and is therefore a suitable starting point for a chromosome walk. These rapid methods of gene mapping and isolation should be applicable to any organism with separable chromosomes.</em></small><br>[ID: 1354851]"

Wariishi H, Valli K, Gold MH<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Manganese oxidation by manganese peroxidase (MnP) was investigated. Stoichiometric, kinetic, and MnII binding studies demonstrated that MnP has a single manganese binding site near the heme, and two MnIII equivalents are formed at the expense of one H2O2 equivalent. Since each catalytic cycle step is irreversible, the data fit a peroxidase ping-pong mechanism rather than an ordered bi-bi ping-pong mechanism. MnIII-organic acid complexes oxidize terminal phenolic substrates in a second-order reaction. MnIII-lactate and -tartrate also react slowly with H2O2, with third-order kinetics. The latter slow reaction does not interfere with the rapid MnP oxidation of phenols. Oxalate and malonate are the only organic acid chelators secreted by the fungus in significant amounts. No relationship between stimulation of enzyme activity and chelator size was found, suggesting that the substrate is free MnII rather than a MnII-chelator complex. The enzyme competes with chelators for free MnII. Optimal chelators, such as malonate, facilitate MnIII dissociation from the enzyme, stabilize MnIII in aqueous solution, and have a relatively low MnII binding constant.</em></small><br>[ID: 1429709]"

Among species of smut fungi it is common to find a bipolar mating system in which one locus with two alternate alleles is believed to control cell fusion and establishment of the infectious cell type.

Valli K, Brock BJ, Joshi DK, Gold MH<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Under ligninolytic conditions, the white rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium mineralizes 2,4-dinitrotoluene (I). The pathway for the degradation of I was elucidated by the characterization of fungal metabolites and oxidation products generated by lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and crude intracellular cell extracts. The multistep pathway involves the initial reduction of I to yield 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene (II). II is oxidized by MnP to yield 4-nitro-1,2-benzoquinone (XII) and methanol. XII is then reduced to 4-nitro-1,2-hydroquinone (V), and the latter is methylated to 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene (X). 4-Nitro-1,2-hydroquinone (V) is also oxidized by MnP to yield nitrite and 2-hydroxybenzoquinone, which is reduced to form 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene (VII). 1,2-Dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene (X) is oxidized by LiP to yield nitrite, methanol, and 2-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (VI), which is reduced to form 2-methoxy-1,4-hydroquinone (IX). The latter is oxidized by LiP and MnP to 4-hydroxy-1,2-benzoquinone, which is reduced to 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene (VII). The key intermediate 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene is ring cleaved by intracellular cell extracts to produce, after reduction, beta-ketoadipic acid. In this pathway, initial reduction of a nitroaromatic group generates the peroxidase substrate II. Oxidation of II releases methanol and generates 4-nitro-1,2-benzoquinone (XII), which is recycled by reduction and methylation reactions to regenerate intermediates which are in turn substrates for peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation leading to removal of the second nitro group. Thus, this unique pathway apparently results in the removal of both aromatic nitro groups before ring cleavage takes place.</em></small><br>[ID: 1539977]"

In this paper, the purification and characterization of a novel extracellular protease secreted by this fungus in solid substrate cultures under ligninolytic conditions are described. The purification steps included extraction of enzymes from the wood substrate, concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography, anion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q), and size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 12). The purified protein migrates with Mr = 40,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It has an isoelectric point of 5.6 and a sharp pH optimum at 4.0. The protease is totally inhibited by Hg2+, p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, and N-bromosuccinimide, but is insensitive to phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, and EDTA. Its amino acid composition and NH2-terminal sequence have also been determined. The sequence data and the binding of the protease to concanavalin A indicate that the protease is a glycoprotein. The protease differs in its physicochemical properties and its response to inhibitors from other extracellular proteases previously found in another strain of P. chrysosporium.

Randall T, Reddy CA, Boominathan K<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A stable extrachromosomally maintained transformation vector (pG12-1) for the lignin-degrading filamentous fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is described. The vector is 6.3 kb and contains a Kanr marker, pBR322 ori, and a 2.2-kb fragment (ME-1) derived from an endogenous extrachromosomal DNA element of P. chrysosporium. Vector pG12-1 was able to transform P. chrysosporium to G418 resistance and was readily and consistently recoverable from the total DNA of transformants via Escherichia coli transformation. Southern blot analyses indicated that pG12-1 is maintained at a low copy number in the fungal transformants. The vector is demonstrable in the total DNA of individual G418-resistant basidiospore progeny of the transformants only after amplification by polymerase chain reaction. Exonuclease III and dam methylation analyses, respectively, indicated that pG12-I undergoes replication in P. chrysosporium and that it is maintained extrachromosomally in a circular form. The vector is stably maintained in the transformants even after long-term nonselective growth. There is no evidence for integration of the vector into the chromosome at any stage.</em></small><br>[ID: 1987163]"

Grant WD, Prosser BA, Asher RA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune produces an extracellular bacteriolytic enzyme when grown on heat-killed cells of Bacillus subtilis as sole C, N and P source. The enzyme catalyses the dissolution of isolated B. subtilis cell walls at an optimum pH of 3.2-3.4, releasing muramyl reducing groups, which indicates that it is a muramidase. Although low levels of enzyme activity are present when the fungus is grown in the absence of bacteria, full enzyme production appears to be induced by bacterial cells and repressed by glucose. Whole bacteria are not lysed by the enzyme at pH 3.3, but are rendered osmotically fragile, and lyse when the pH is raised to 7 or higher. The muramidase is effective against several Gram-positive bacteria but did not lyse any of the Gram-negative species tested.</em></small><br>[ID: 2127798]"

Cassidy JR, Pukkila PJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In the basidiomycete fungus Coprinus cinereus, the 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are found in the rDNA repeat which encodes the other three rRNAs (18S, 5.8S, and 26S), and all genes are transcribed in the same direction (Cassidy et al. 1984). To facilitate examination of the rRNA gene organization in additional species, we developed a method to permit determination of the direction of transcription of the rRNA genes using crude preparations of genomic DNA. We used this method to determine the organization of the rDNA in five other members of the order Agaricales (Flammulina velutipes, Agaricus bisporus, Coprinus micaceus, Coprinus atramentarius, and Coprinus comatus). In four, the organization is the same as it is in Coprinus cinereus. However, in Coprinus comatus, the 5S RNA gene is present in the rDNA repeat, but is transcribed in the opposite direction. This alteration in rDNA organization within the genus Coprinus indicates that inverted 5S genes can arise and become propagated through the tandem array of genes. The presence of orientation-dependent promoter elements within the spacer DNA (Elion and Warner 1984) would be expected to place constraints on such inversions.</em></small><br>[ID: 2835172]"

       "<strong>Spectral characterization of diarylpropane oxygenase, a novel peroxide-dependent, lignin-degrading heme enzyme.</strong><br>1985. Andersson LA, Renganathan V, Chiu AA, Loehr TM, Gold MH<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Diarylpropane oxygenase, an H2O2-dependent lignin-degrading enzyme from the basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, catalyzes the oxygenation of various lignin model compounds with incorporation of a single atom of dioxygen (O2). Diarylpropane oxygenase is also capable of oxidizing some alcohols to aldehydes and/or ketones. This enzyme (Mr = 41,000) contains a single iron protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group. Previous studies revealed that the Soret maximum of the ferrous-CO complex of diarylpropane oxygenase is at approximately 420 nm, as in ferrous-CO myoglobin (Mb), and not like the approximately 450 nm absorption of the CO complex of the ubiquitous heme monooxygenase, cytochrome P-450. This spectral difference between two functionally similar heme enzymes is of interest. To elucidate the structural requirements for heme iron-based oxygenase reactions, we have compared the electronic absorption, EPR, and resonance Raman (RR) spectral properties of diarylpropane oxygenase with those of other heme proteins and enzymes of known axial ligation. The absorption spectra of native (ferric), cyano, and ferrous diarylpropane oxygenase closely resemble those of the analogous myoglobin complexes. The EPR g values of native diarylpropane oxygenase, 5.83 and 1.99, also agree well with those of aquometMb. The RR spectra of ferric diarylpropane oxygenase have their spin- and oxidation-state marker bands at frequencies analogous to those of aquometMb and indicate a high-spin, hexacoordinate ferric iron. The RR spectra of ferrous diarylpropane oxygenase have frequencies analogous to those of deoxy-Mb that suggest a high-spin, pentacoordinate Fe(II) in the reduced form. The RR spectra of both ferric and ferrous diarylpropane oxygenase are less similar to those of horseradish peroxidase, catalase, or cytochrome c peroxidase and are clearly distinct from those of P-450. These observations suggest that the fifth ligand to the heme iron of diarylpropane oxygenase is a neutral histidine and that the iron environment must resemble that of the oxygen transport protein, myoglobin, rather than that of the peroxidases, catalase, or P-450. Given the functional similarity between diarylpropane oxygenase and P-450, this work implies that the mechanism of oxygen insertion for the two systems is different.</em></small><br>[ID: 2987213]"

Wariishi H, Akileswaran L, Gold MH<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Manganese peroxidase (MnP), an extracellular heme enzyme from the lignin-degrading fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, catalyzes the Mn(II)-dependent oxidation of a variety of phenols. Herein, we spectroscopically characterize the oxidized states of MnP compounds I, II, and III and clarify the role of Mn in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. Addition of 1 equiv of H2O2 to the native ferric enzyme yields compound I, characterized by absorption maxima at 407, 558, 605, and 650 nm. Addition of 2 or 250 equiv of H2O2 to the native enzyme yields compound II or III, respectively, identified by absorption maxima at 420, 528, and 555 nm or at 417, 545, and 579 nm, respectively. These characteristics are very similar to those of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) compounds I, II, and III. Addition of 1 equiv of either Mn(II), ferrocyanide, or a variety of phenols to MnP compound I rapidly reduces it to MnP compound II. In contrast, only Mn(II) or ferrocyanide, added at a concentration of 1 equiv, reduces compound II. The Mn(III) produced by the enzymic oxidation of Mn(II) oxidizes the terminal phenolic substrates. This indicates that compounds I and II of MnP contain 2 and 1 oxidizing equiv, respectively, over the native ferric resting enzyme and that the catalytic cycle of the enzyme follows the path native enzyme----compound I----compound II----native enzyme. In addition, these results indicate that Mn(II) serves as an obligatory substrate for MnP compound II, allowing the enzyme to complete its catalytic cycle. Finally, the Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox couple enables the enzyme to rapidly oxidize the terminal phenolic substrates.</em></small><br>[ID: 3167051]"

Analysis of 14 transformants not expressing acu-7 showed that four contained transforming DNA sequences and significantly, two had evidence of non-homologously integrated tandem duplications of the entire acu-7 plasmid DNA. The site of integration of the gene was thus important in determining whether or not it was expressed and to what level it was expressed.

Extracts of Coprinus quadrifidus spores, caps, and stalks were prepared and fractionated by gel filtration column chromatography on Sephadex G-75. Analysis of column fractions of each separation by ultraviolet absorption demonstrated at least three peaks of absorbency in spore, cap, and stalk extracts. Pooled column fractions were analysed by direct radio-allergosorbent test (RAST) using pooled sera from C. quadrifidus skin-test positive subjects. Enhanced allergenic activity was present in the same portion of the column eluate for cap, spore, and stalk fractionations, corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 10.5-25 kD. Pools with allergenic activity were used to test volunteers by skin prick and RAST. Skin test and RAST activities were similar for each of the three Coprinus extracts, with stalk being the most potent. Evidence of common allergenic epitopes was demonstrated by inhibition of spore RAST by spore, cap, and stalk extracts.

The estimated Mrs of mature LG4 and LG5 are 36,540 and 36,607, respectively. Potential N-glycosylation site(s) with the general sequence Asn-X-Thr/Ser are found in both LG4 and LG5.

Also, the sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotide probes, which correspond to the sequences in the tryptic peptides of ligninase H8 and which were used in isolating the ligninase clones from the cDNA library, have exactly matching sequences in CLG5. The experimentally determined N-terminal sequence of purified ligninase H8 is found in the deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence of LG5.

Bitar KG, Vinogradov SN, Nolan C, Weiss LJ, Margoliash E<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>1. The complete amino acid sequence of cytochrome c from the basidiomycete Ustilago sphaerogena was determined from the amino acid compositions and sequences of either tryptic or chymotryptic peptides, and in homology with at least thirty other established sequences of cytochrome c. 2. The primary structure of the molecule bears all of the characteristics of a mammalian-type cytochrome c, showing the typical clustered distribution of hydrophobic and basic residues with a single polypeptide chain of 107 residues. 3. Like all other fungal cytochromes c, it possesses a free N-terminus, and one less residue at the C-terminus than vertebrate cytochromes c. The region of residues 70-80 is strictly conserved, as is histidine at position 18. Position 26 is occupied by an asparagine residue, in contrast to histidine which occurs at this location in most of the known sequences of mammalian-type cytochromes c. 4. In contrast to some other fungal and plant cytochromes c of known primary structures, the Ustilago cytochrome c molecule does not contain trimethyl-lysine. 5. The sequence of Ustilago cytochrome c differs from the sequences of human, horse, chicken, tuna, wheat, and baker's yeast proteins at loci 47, 43, 44, 44 and 38 respectively.</em></small><br>[ID: 4349112]"

The enzymes leading to the methylation of homocysteine have been examined in three micro-organisms: a cobalamin-producing bacterium, Bacillus megaterium; a yeast, Candida utilis; and a basidiomycete fungus, Coprinus lagopus. The yeast and the fungus contain negligible endogenous cobalamin. 2. Extracts of each organism catalyse C(1)-transfer from serine to homocysteine with a polyglutamate folate coenzyme. 3. The enzymes generating the methyl group of methionine from C-3 of serine have similar properties in each case, but different mechanisms of homocysteine transmethylation from 5-methyltetrahydrofolates were found. 4. B. megaterium contains an enzyme with properties suggestive of a vitamin B(12)-dependent homocysteine transmethylase, whereas Cand. utilis and Cop. lagopus transfer the methyl group by a reaction characteristic of the cobalamin-independent mechanism established for Escherichia coli. 5. The specificity of each transmethylase for a 5-methyltetrahydropteroylpolyglutamate is consistent with the results of analyses of endogenous folates in these organisms, which showed only conjugated forms. 6. None of the extracts catalysed methionine production from S-adenosylmethionine and homocysteine. 7.

We have now defined the structure of a new MIP homologue (SMIP) from the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune. SMIP includes 4 exons of 523, 486, 660, and 629 bp separated by 3 short introns.

Moreover, the MIP sequences show 20-24% identity and 40-47% similarity to a family of oligopeptidases from bacteria, yeast, and mammals. MIP and these proteins are characterized by a highly conserved motif, F-H-E-X-G-H-(X)2-H-(X)12-G-(X)5-D-(X)2-E-X-P-S-(X)3-E-X, centered around a zinc-binding site and appear to represent a new family of genes associated with proteolytic processing in the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments.</em></small><br>[ID: 7490080]"

Horton JS, Raper CA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fruiting bodies (mushrooms) can be induced to form in unmated, normally non-fruiting strains of the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune by the ectopic genomic integration of a cloned gene called Frt1. Thus, the normal requirement of mating for mushroom formation is bypassed. Sequence analysis of genomic and cDNA clones revealed that the Frt1 gene encodes a predicted polypeptide of 192 amino acids, interrupted by three short introns. The FRT1 protein is predicted to be of M(r) 21,625 and does not have significant overall similarity to any known proteins. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a P-loop motif, a conserved sequence found in nucleotide-binding proteins. A potential site for Mg2+ binding is predicted to reside next to the P-loop at Thr24. The possible functional significance of these and other residues within FRT1 was examined using site-directed mutagenesis, followed by transformation of these mutant alleles of Frt1 back into S. commune. Mutation of the middle glycine of the P-loop completely abolished the fruit-inducing activity of cloned Frt1. Substitution of an alanine residue for Thr24 also resulted in mutant clones with no fruit-inducing activity. The possibility of an interaction between two closely spaced threonine residues within FRT1 was suggested by transformation experiments utilizing mutant Frt1 alleles with specific combinations of mutations at these sites. Taken together, the results of our mutagenesis experiments suggest the possibility that activity of the predicted FRT1 protein could be altered by nucleotide binding and coordination of Mg2+. Northern blot hybridization experiments indicate that Frt1 activity is probably not controlled at the transcriptional level.</em></small><br>[ID: 7770041]"

Salas C, Lobos S, Larraín J, Salas L, Cullen D, Vicuña R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Laccase is one of the ligninolytic enzymes found in liquid cultures of the fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora in defined medium. As an approach to a clarification of the role of laccases during the attack on lignin by the fungus, the enzyme has been characterized further. The levels of this phenol oxidase increase 2-fold in the presence of p-anisidine and are severely affected when addition of either Mn(II) or Cu(II) ions to the medium is omitted. Isoelectrofocusing allowed the resolution of two laccase isoenzymes, with pIs of 3.65 and 3.59. In rich medium, laccase activity is 10-fold higher than in salt medium, and it is not affected by the external addition of p-anisidine or Mn(II). Four isoenzymes were detected in these cultures, with pIs between 3.76 and 3.60. In a wheat bran medium, four isoenzymes with pIs in the range 3.63-3.46, plus a fifth isoenzyme of high pI (4.82), were also identified. The absorption spectrum of a pool containing the four isoenzymes from rich medium shows a maximum at 600 nm, typical of laccase possessing a type I copper atom. The molecular mass of the isoenzyme with pI 3.60 is 79 kDa, as determined by SDS/PAGE. Upon treatment with endoglycosidase F, the molecular mass of this isoform decreases to 63 kDa, indicating a high degree of glycosylation. Substrate specificity studies conducted with the four isoenzymes from rich medium and a combination of isoenzymes from salt medium showed marked differences among them. The amino-terminal sequences (24 residues) of three isoenzymes isolated from rich medium were determined. Two of them are identical, whereas the third one differs from these in three amino acid residues. The consensus sequence reveals clear homology with laccases from other microorganisms.</em></small><br>[ID: 7794534]"

Bakkeren G, Kronstad JW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Sexual compatibility requires self vs. non-self recognition. Genetically, two compatibility or mating-type systems govern recognition in heterothallic basidiomycete fungi such as the edible and woodrotting mushrooms and the economically important rust and smut phytopathogens. A bipolar system is defined by a single genetic locus (MAT) that can have two or multiple alleles. A tetrapolar system has two loci, each with two or more specificities. We have employed two species from the genus Ustilago (smut fungi) to discover a molecular explanation for the genetic difference in mating systems. Ustilago maydis, a tetrapolar species, has two genetically unlinked loci that encode the distinct mating functions of cell fusion (a locus) and subsequent sexual development and pathogenicity (b locus). We have recently described a b locus in a bipolar species, Ustilago hordei, wherein the existence of an a locus has been suspected, but not demonstrated. We report here the cloning of an allele of the a locus (a1) from U. hordei and the discovery that physical linkage of the a and b loci in this bipolar fungus accounts for the distinct mating system. Linkage establishes a large complex MAT locus in U. hordei; this locus appears to be in a region suppressed for recombination.</em></small><br>[ID: 7913746]"

Zolan ME, Heyler NK, Stassen NY<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We have investigated the inheritance of chromosome-length polymorphisms in the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus. The electrophoretic karyotypes of interfertile strains of C. cinereus are strikingly different, and crosses between strains with different karyotypes yield progeny with chromosomes of new sizes. Repeated backcrossing of a mutant to one parent often stabilizes the mutant chromosome at a unique size; this then becomes a chromosome-length polymorphism marker for that mutant gene. A comparison of mutant strains, their wild-type progenitor, and backcrossed strains revealed that these marker chromosomes are not caused by the initial mutagenic treatment and are found only in progeny of crosses between strains with polymorphic chromosomes. Thus, they are most likely formed by meiotic recombination. For the rad12 gene, the marker chromosome can further recombine to become the size of the homolog of the backcross parent. For the rad3 gene, both ectopic and homologous recombination events are likely involved in the generation of the marker chromosomes. As predicted by a recombination model, a cross to a new wild-type parent can change the size of a mutant marker chromosome. Therefore, changes in chromosome length are a common and prominent feature of the genome of this sexual fungus, and a variety of karyotypes is tolerated by the organism.</em></small><br>[ID: 7914506]"

Banuett F, Herskowitz I<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ustilago maydis is a plant pathogenic Basidiomycete fungus that exhibits dimorphism--it has a haploid, yeast-like phase and a dikaryotic, filamentous phase that is pathogenic. Establishment and maintenance of these two forms are controlled by two mating type loci, a and b. The a locus is thought to govern fusion of haploid cells to form a dikaryon and is also required for filamentous growth of the dikaryon. It encodes two components of a pheromone response pathway: pheromones and receptors. We report the identification of the U. maydis fuz7 gene, which codes for a putative dual specificity serine/threonine tyrosine kinase of the MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK/MEK) family, by homology with other members of the family. Analysis of mutants deleted for fuz7 shows that it participates in different facets of the life cycle: It is necessary for a-locus-dependent processes, such as conjugation tube formation, filament formation, and maintenance of filamentous growth, and for a-locus-independent processes, such as tumor induction and teliospore germination. fuz7 is the first U. maydis gene distinct from the b locus required for fungal pathogenicity. We propose that fuz7 is involved in at least two pathways, one of which responds to the pheromones coded by the a locus and the other to putative signals from the plant.</em></small><br>[ID: 7926737]"

Gene cloning, sequence analysis, expression, and purification of the recombinant enzyme.</strong><br>1994. Reiser J, Muheim A, Hardegger M, Frank G, Fiechter A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A cDNA clone encoding a ligninolytic aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (AAD; EC 1.1.1.91) from the white-rot basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was isolated and characterized. The nucleotide sequence obtained reveals an open reading frame encoding a protein of 385 amino acids. Substantial homology (49.3% identity and 67.3% similarity, respectively) was observed between AAD and an open reading frame sequence present on chromosome III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A Southern blot analysis showed the presence of multiple AAD gene-related sequences in P. chrysosporium and in other white-rot fungi including Bjerkandera adusta and Fomes lignosus. Northern blot analyses are in line with the view that the levels and appearance of AAD mRNA correlate with the level and appearance of AAD activity and that, under conditions of nitrogen limitation, the AAD mRNA levels are higher than in carbon limited cultures. This is consistent with the regulation of the enzyme by carbon or nitrogen limitation being at the level of transcription. Moreover, the appearance of AAD-specific transcripts correlates with the appearance of lignin peroxidase-specific transcripts in the same cultures. This co-appearance is in line with the proposed synergistic interaction of the two enzymes in lignin biodegradation, which suggests a similar regulation. The AAD encoding cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli to yield high levels of active enzyme, and the recombinant enzyme was purified by using metal chelate affinity chromatography.</em></small><br>[ID: 7961751]"

Occasionally, a fifth laccase isoform of pI 4.70 was also detected. In cultures with 25 and 40 p.p.m. of Mn(II), mainly the MnPs with higher pI values are produced. The isoenzyme pattern of MnP is not altered throughout the growth period of the fungus. MnP and laccase are also produced by C. subvermispora when growing on wood chips of Pinus radiata.

Spadaro JT, Renganathan V<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Disperse Yellow 3 [2-(4'-acetamidophenylazo)-4-methylphenol] (DY3) (I) is an important yellow dye used in industry and is also a carcinogen. Earlier we demonstrated that lignin-degrading cultures of white-rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium degrade DY3 to CO2. In this report, we have examined the degradation of DY3 and its naphthol analog, 1-(4'-acetamidophenylazo)-2-naphthol (NDY3) (II) by lignin peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and Mn(III)-malonate complex (a manganese peroxidase mimic). Lignin and manganese peroxidases are two extracellular peroxidase produced by ligninolytic cultures of P. chrysosporium and are involved in the degradation of lignin and various other environmental pollutants by this fungus. DY3 oxidation by peroxidases yields 4-methyl-1,2-benzoquinone (III), acetanilide (IV), and a dimer of DY3 (V) as products. NDY3 oxidation yields acetanilide (IV) and 1,2-naphthoquinone (VI). In deuterium incorporation experiments with DY3, 55-67% incorporation of deuterium from dioxane-d8 into acetanilide (IV) is observed. However, when D2O is the donor, deuterium is not incorporated into acetanilide (IV). Based on these results, a mechanism for azo dye degradation is proposed. The H2O2-oxidized forms of a peroxidase oxidize the phenolic ring of DY3, or its analogs, by two electrons to produce a carbonium ion, which is located on the carbon bearing the azo linkage. Water attacks the carbonium ion, producing an unstable intermediate which breaks down to generate 1,2-naphthoquinone (VI) or 4-methyl-1,2-benzoquinone (III) and 4-acetamido-phenyldiazene. O2, H2O2-oxidized peroxidase, or a metal ion, oxidize the phenyldiazene by one electron to produce a phenyldiazene radical, which cleaves homolytically to generate 4-acetamidophenyl radical and molecular nitrogen. The 4-acetamidophenyl radical then abstracts a hydrogen radical from the surroundings to produce acetanilide (IV). DY3 degradation by whole cultures of P. chrysosporium yields acetanilide as the major product. This suggests that lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase are involved in the in vivo metabolism of DY3 by P. chrysosporium.</em></small><br>[ID: 8031141]"

Specht CA, Stankis MM, Novotny CP, Ullrich RC<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Classical genetic studies identified nine mating-type specificities at the A alpha locus of the Basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune. We have used Southern blot hybridizations to generate EcoRI restriction maps of the A alpha locus for 18 strains, including all nine specificities. A alpha 1, A alpha 3 and A alpha 4 DNA was subcloned from three cosmids and used as probes. A unique region of DNA was found for each of the three cloned specificities. Hybridization was detected in this region only if the probe(s) and the blotted genomic DNAs were from strains with the same A alpha specificity. DNAs from strains with the same A alpha specificity hybridize regardless of geographic origin, but DNAs from strains with different A alpha specificities do not cross-hybridize. The results demonstrate two size classes of unique A alpha DNA. This unique DNA is about 4.5 kb in A alpha 1 strains and about 7.0-8.5 kb in other strains. Transcription regulators Z and Y, which were deduced previously from the DNA sequence of the A alpha 1, A alpha 3 and A alpha 4 loci, are probably encoded by all non-A alpha 1 loci. The smaller A alpha 1 loci appear to encode only Y and lack sequence for Z. No evidence was found for a locus that encodes only Z. The lack of hybridization detected between A alpha loci with different specificities suggests that the evolution of A alpha has resulted from extensive sequence divergence.</em></small><br>[ID: 8088516]"

Of the compounds synthesized the five indane-2-acid derivatives 5-acetylindane-2-carboxylic acid (2), (+/-)5-formylindane-2-carboxylic acid (3), (+/-)indane-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (4), (+/-)formyl-2-methylindane-2-carboxylic acid (7) and 5-acetyl-indane-2,2-dicarboxylic acid (10) and 4-(2'-ethylbutyloxy)benzaldehyde (18) have not yet been described. Different biological test systems were employed to investigate the antibiotic activities of the synthesized analogues. The experimental results suggest that in the case of fomajorin S, the structural element essential for its toxicity is the 2-H- or 2-methylindane 2-acid. From the results obtained with the synthetic analogues of fomannoxin, it is now evident that the toxicity of this fungal metabolite can be attributed to an aromatic ring with a carbonyl or carboxyl substituent combined with a branched lipophilic side chain in p-substitution.</em></small><br>[ID: 8292264]"

Two pyranosone dehydratase activity peaks, PD I and PD II, were resolved. The major PD I fraction, consisting about 74% of the total dehydratase activity, was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q to yield apparently pure enzyme as judged by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration on Superose 12. Isoelectric focusing indicated microheterogeneity of the protein by the presence of at least five protein bands with pI 5.1-5.3. PD II had a pI of 5.75.

The latter labile compounds were trapped as diphenylhydrazine or o-phenylenediamine derivatives and spectroscopically identified.

Johansson T, Nyman PO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Trametes versicolor is a white-rot fungus and a potent degrader of lignin. The development of extracellular enzyme activities in the fungal culture under physiological conditions of secondary metabolism was investigated. Using the culture medium as starting material a large number of peroxidase forms were purified by the use of chromatographic techniques. Sixteen forms of lignin peroxidase and five forms of manganese(II) peroxidase were separated and the majority of these enzymes was characterized with respect to isoelectric point, molecular mass, and specific enzyme activity. The manganese(II) peroxidases showed a lower isoelectric point (pI 3.2-2.9) and a slightly higher molecular mass (44-45 kDa) than the lignin peroxidases (pI 3.7-3.1, and 41-43 kDa). Specific enzyme activities for the forms of lignin peroxidase, using veratryl alcohol as the substrate, were found to differ considerably. Certain differences in the specific enzyme activity were also observed among the forms of manganese(II) peroxidase. A multitude of peroxidase forms has previously been encountered in another white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The discovery that it also occurs in T. versicolor would suggest that this multiplicity could be a common feature among white-rot fungi and may be essential for the biodegradation of lignin.</em></small><br>[ID: 8424685]"

Johansson T, Welinder KG, Nyman PO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Trametes versicolor, a white-rot fungus and potent degrader of lignin, produces multiple forms of extracellular peroxidases. Nine of these forms, six lignin peroxidases and three manganese(II) peroxidases, purified as described in the preceding paper, were characterized by amino-terminal sequencing, amino acid analyses, carbohydrate analyses, or peptide mapping. For two of the lignin peroxidase forms, tryptic peptides were isolated and sequenced to an extent corresponding to about 40 and 30%, respectively, of the primary structure. Eight of the nine peroxidases investigated were found to possess unique amino-terminal regions. A comparison of the sequences shows 57% of the residues to be identical, indicating a common ancestry for the lignin peroxidase and the manganese(II) peroxidase. The degree of identity among the five lignin peroxidases is about 80% and among the three manganese(II) peroxidases about 70%. Pairwise comparisons of the sequences disclosed that some of the lignin peroxidases are very closely related, either identical or differing only in a single amino acid residue of the thirty-five investigated. These close relationships are also supported by peptide mapping and by similarities in amino acid compositions. Tyr is absent in all isozymes. Lignin and manganese(II) peroxidases showed the presence of glucosamine and mannose in an amount corresponding to 3 to 6% of the molecular mass of the proteins. The carbohydrate compositions are compatible with the presence of 1, 2, and 3 sites of N-glycosylation. The results obtained strongly suggest that the complexity in the peroxidase pattern displayed by the fungus (T. Johansson and P.O. Nyman, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 300, 49-56, 1993) can largely be accounted for by a heterogeneity at the gene level, probably in the form of multiple structural genes. Two recently published genes from genomic clones of T. versicolor are identical in sequence to two of the lignin peroxidases characterized here.</em></small><br>[ID: 8424691]"

A substantially greater extent of degradation of all the BTEX compounds was observed in static than in shaken liquid cultures.

Johansson T, Nyman PO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A gene cluster from the white-rot basidiomycete Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor (Tv) PRL 572 containing three structural genes, LPGIII, LPGIV and MPGI, was characterized. The genes are arranged in the same transcriptional direction, within a 10-kb region, and found to encode quantitatively dominant isozymes of lignin peroxidase (LP) and manganese peroxidase (MP). The second gene in sequence, LPGIV, predicts a 346-amino-acid (aa) mature polypeptide (36.9 kDa, pI 4.31) which is identical with the partial aa sequence information available on the LP12 isozyme (43.1 kDa, pI 3.27). The first gene, LPGIII, encodes a 341-aa polypeptide (36.1 kDa, pI 3.93) which has not been identified at the protein level. However, the similarity of LPGIV would suggest that the predicted product is an LP-type enzyme. LPGIII and LPGIV are homologous to the tandemly arranged genes LPGII and LPGI, respectively, recently described by Jönsson and Nyman [Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1218 (1994) 408-412]. The homologous genes, LPGIII/LPGII and LPGIV/LPGI, are 99% and 96% identical in sequence, respectively, and are predicted to encode identical polypeptides, since base substitutions in the predicted exons are all synonymous. The third gene, MPGI, is different in intron-exon organization and predicted to be disrupted by five rather than six introns, as are the LP genes. The deduced polypeptide, 339 aa in size (35.9 kDa, pI 4.07), is identical with the partial aa sequence information available for isozyme MP2 (44.5 kDa, pI 3.09). The MPGI- and LPGIV-encoded polypeptides are 70% identical in sequence which suggests that MP and LP from Tv may be regarded as members of the same family within the plant peroxidase superfamily. Most importantly, this study identifies a gene encoding the MP2 isozyme, and further shows that genes encoding MP and LP can be closely linked on the chromosome and may be coordinately transcribed.</em></small><br>[ID: 8621085]"

Shen GP, Park DC, Ullrich RC, Novotny CP<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The A-pathway of development in the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune may be activated by either of two mating-type loci, A alpha and A beta. A alpha consists of two multiallelic genes, Y and Z. Y contains a putative homeodomain; Z contains a homeodomain-related region. Non-self combinations of Y and Z form heteromultimers which are thought to be transcription factors of developmental genes. To more completely understand A-regulated development it is necessary to address the issue of functional redundancy, i.e., how do two different mating loci, A alpha and A beta, both manage to regulate the same pathway. Here we report the structure of a gene with A beta 6 activity. This gene, denoted A beta V6, encodes a deduced polypeptide of 640 amino-acids with a homeodomain motif. V6 also contains a 20-amino acid sequence that is conserved in A alpha Y1, Y3 and Y4. Except for the homeodomain and the conserved sequence, the deduced V6 polypeptide shows no significant identity to A alpha Y, A alpha Z, or other known proteins. The presence of a homeodomain suggests that V, like Y and Z, may be a regulatory protein for genes in the A-pathway. Thus while A alpha and A beta encode different proteins, the general mechanism by which A alpha and A beta components signal A-regulated development may be similar.</em></small><br>[ID: 8821660]"

A few of the white rot fungi, as well as Gloeophyllum trabeum, a brown rot fungus, gave a 144-bp PCR fragment which had a nucleotide sequence similarity of 60 to 71%. Demonstration of laccase activity in G. trabeum and several other brown rot fungi was of particular interest because these organisms were not previously shown to produce laccases.</em></small><br>[ID: 8837429]"

Monzer J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In search for the cellular mechanisms of graviperception in basidiomycete fruit bodies, nuclear and vacuole motility was investigated in the fungus, Flammulina velutipes. In this organism, hyphal nuclei are closely linked with the actin cytoskeleton, which is involved in gravity perception. Active motion of the nuclei appears aligned with the axis of gravity, and is maintained after spatial reorientation of the cell. The vacuoles showed low motility not aligned with the gravity axis at all. The nuclear density was determined with 1.22 g/cm3. Calculation of the forces exerted by the nuclei shows that nuclear displacement in the submicrometer range already fulfills the physical minimum condition for a statolith. Based on these findings, a function of nuclei as statoliths in basidiomycete hyphae is proposed.</em></small><br>[ID: 8905300]"

Volc J, Kubátová E, Wood DA, Daniel G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A novel C-2-specific sugar oxidoreductase, tentatively designated as pyranose 2-dehydrogenase, was purified 68-fold to apparent homogeneity (16.4 U/mg protein) from the mycelia of Agaricus bisporus, which expressed maximum activity of the enzyme during idiophasic growth in liquid media. Using 1,4-benzoquinone as an electron acceptor, pyranose 2-dehydrogenase oxidized d-glucose to d-arabino-2-hexosulose (2-dehydroglucose, 2-ketoglucose), which was identified spectroscopically through its N,N-diphenylhydrazone. The enzyme is highly nonspecific. d-,l-Arabinose, d-ribose, d-xylose, d-galactose, and several oligosaccharides and glycopyranosides were all converted to the corresponding 2-aldoketoses (aldosuloses) as indicated by TLC. d-Glucono-1,5-lactone, d-arabino-2-hexosulose, and l-sorbose were also oxidized at significant rates. UV/VIS spectrum of the native enzyme (lambdamax 274, 362, and 465 nm) was consistent with a flavin prosthetic group. In contrast to oligomeric intracellular pyranose 2-oxidase (EC 1.1.3.10), pyranose 2-dehydrogenase is a monomeric glycoprotein (pI 4.2) incapable of reducing O2 to H2O2 (> 5 x 10(4)-fold lower rate using a standard pyranose oxidase assay); pyranose 2-dehydrogenase is actively secreted into the extracellular fluid (up to 0.5 U/ml culture filtrate). The dehydrogenase has a native molecular mass of approximately 79 kDa as determined by gel filtration; its subunit molecular mass is approximately 75 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Two pH optima of the enzyme were found, one alkaline at pH 9 (phosphate buffer) and the other acidic at pH 4 (acetate buffer).

Mester T, Swarts HJ, Romero i Sole S, de Bont JA, Field JA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Aryl metabolites are known to have an important role in the ligninolytic system of white rot fungi. The addition of known precursors and aromatic acids representing lignin degradation products stimulated the production of aryl metabolites (veratryl alcohol, veratraldehyde, p-anisaldehyde, and 3-chloro-p-anisaldehyde) in the white rot fungus Bjerkandera sp. strain BOS55. The presence of manganese (Mn) is known to inhibit the biosynthesis of veratryl alcohol (T. Mester, E. de Jong, and J.A. Field, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:1881-1887, 1995). A new finding of this study was that the production of the other aryl metabolites, p-anisaldehyde and 3-chloro-p-anisaldehyde, was also inhibited by Mn. We attempted to bypass the Mn-inhibited step in the biosynthesis of aryl metabolites by the addition of known and suspected precursors. Most of these compounds were not able to bypass the inhibiting effect of Mn. Only the fully methylated precursors (veratrate, p-anisate, and 3-chloro-p-anisate) provided similar concentrations of aryl metabolites in the presence and absence of Mn, indicating that Mn does not influence the reduction of the benzylic acid group. The addition of deuterated benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate resulted in the formation of deuterated aryl metabolites, indicating that these aromatic acids entered into the biosynthetic pathway and were common intermediates to all aryl metabolites. Only deuterated chlorinated anisyl metabolites were produced when the cultures were supplemented with deuterated 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate. This observation combined with the fact that 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate is a natural product of Bjerkandera spp. (H. J. Swarts, F. J. M. Verhagen, J. A. Field, and J. B. P. A. Wijnberg, Phytochemistry 42:1699-1701, 1996) suggest that it is a possible intermediate in chlorinated anisyl metabolite biosynthesis.</em></small><br>[ID: 9143129]"

Cruz MC, Edlind T<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients, and available chemotherapeutic agents are potentially toxic or have limited efficacy. In vitro, C. neoformans is very sensitive to selected benzimidazole compounds (e.g. albendazole), which act by disrupting microtubules through binding to the beta-tubulin subunit. To understand the basis for this benzimidazole sensitivity, we have characterized C. neoformans beta-tubulin genes and their expression. Analysis of PCR amplification products, genomic and cDNA clones and Southern blots identified two beta-tubulin genes. TUB1 contains seven introns, including one that splits the start codon, and encodes a 447 amino acid protein with > 80% identity to most other beta-tubulins. A partial sequence of TUB2 revealed a higher density of introns and a considerably more divergent beta-tubulin. The relative expression of TUB1 to TUB2 determined by reverse-transcription PCR was about 3:1, consistent with a more limited role for the TUB2 product. Comparisons of beta-tubulin sequences from C. neoformans and from various benzimidazole-sensitive and -resistant organisms strongly suggest that the TUB1 product represents the primary benzimidazole target. This was supported by the identification of a His6 to Gln change in TUB1 from three independently isolated albendazole-resistant mutants.</em></small><br>[ID: 9202476]"

It has been classified as a member of the Polyporaceae family. The major ligninolytic activity detected in culture supernatants of basidiomycete I-62 was a phenoloxidase (laccase), in conjunction with small amounts of manganese peroxidase. No lignin peroxidase was detected. Laccase activity was produced in either defined or complete media. Addition of veratryl alcohol as the inducer, in defined medium, enhanced laccase production 10-fold. The use of fructose instead of glucose as a carbon source resulted in a 100-fold increase in laccase specific activity. Native isoelectrofocusing gels stained with guaiacol revealed the presence of at least seven laccase isozymes, with the most intense band being detected at pI 3. Southern hybridization analysis indicated the presence of a laccase gene family in strain I-62. Three different genes coding for phenoloxidases, lcc1, lcc2, and lcc3, were cloned and characterized. The high degree of homology between laccases from strain I-62 and laccases from Trametes species suggests a phylogenetic proximity between this new isolated fungus and the genus Trametes.</em></small><br>[ID: 9212414]"

Each A alpha mating type encodes unique Y and Z isoforms. We used two isoforms of Y (Y4 and Y5) and two isoforms of Z (Z4 and Z5) in affinity assays of protein binding. These assays identified two types of protein interactions. Each full-length Y or Z protein binds to itself and other Y or Z proteins regardless of the A alpha mating type from which they are encoded (i.e., mating-type independent binding). A second type of binding, detected with partial-length polypeptides, occurs only between N-terminal regions of Y and Z proteins encoded from different A alpha mating types (e.g., Y4Z5 or Y5Z4); we refer to this binding as mating-type dependent binding. Deletion analysis shows that the Y4 specificity domain (an N-terminal region conferring recognition uniqueness to the Y4 isoform) is essential for mating-type dependent binding. Other regions of Y and Z are involved in mating-type independent binding. These results, obtained in vitro, raise the possibility that either of several protein complexes composed of Y and/or Z proteins may occur in vivo.</em></small><br>[ID: 9286672]"

Hurek T, Wagner B, Reinhold-Hurek B<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Most species of the diazotrophic Proteobacteria Azoarcus spp. occur in association with grass roots, while A. tolulyticus and A. evansii are soil bacteria not associated with a plant host. To facilitate species identification and strain comparison, we developed a protocol for PCR-generated genomic fingerprints, using an automated sequencer for fragment analysis. Commonly used primers targeted to REP (repetitive extragenic palindromic) and ERIC (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus) sequence elements failed to amplify fragments from the two species tested. In contrast, the BOX-PCR assay (targeted to repetitive intergenic sequence elements of Streptococcus) yielded species-specific genomic fingerprints with some strain-specific differences. PCR profiles of an additional PCR assay using primers targeted to tRNA genes (tDNA-PCR, for tRNA(IIe)) were more discriminative, allowing differentiation at species-specific (for two species) or infraspecies-specific level. Our protocol of several consecutive PCR assays consisted of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-targeted, genus-specific PCR followed by BOX- and tDNA-PCR; it enabled us to assign new diazotrophic isolates originating from fungal resting stages (sclerotia) to known species of Azoarcus. The assignment was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences. Additionally, the phylogenetic distances and the lack of monophyly suggested emendment of the genus Azoarcus: the unnamed species Azoarcus groups C and D and a new group (E) of Azoarcus, which was detected in association with fungi, are likely to have the taxonomic rank of three different genera. According to its small subunit rRNA, the sclerotium-forming basidiomycete was related to the Ustilagomycetes, facultatively biotrophic parasites of plants.

Physiological studies suggested that a gene that functions upstream of adenylyl cyclase was deleted in the mutant. Representational difference analysis of isolated chromosomes was used to obtain deletion-specific DNA probes and corresponding genomic cosmid clones. Complementation analysis identified a cosmid clone and subsequently a 2.1-kb insert that converted transformants of the mutant strain 10.1a(fil1) from the filamentous to the sporidial cell type. A single open reading frame of 354 codons that encodes a putative alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-proteins was identified. Fil1 displayed a high degree of sequence identity to Gpa1 from the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans and CPG-2 from the ascomycete Cryphonectria parasitica. FIL1, when introduced on a self-replicating vector, was found to suppress filamentous growth of starved haploid wild-type strains and restore normal mating response to the fil1 mutant, but did not suppress sexual dimorphism of either strain. Fil1 appears to function analogously to mammalian G alpha proteins, which are coupled to cAMP production via adenylyl cyclase, to regulate dimorphic switching in U. hordei.</em></small><br>[ID: 9393440]"

Saville BJ, Kohli Y, Anderson JB<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Variation in mtDNA has been used extensively to draw inferences in phylogenetics and population biology. In the majority of eukaryotes investigated, transmission of mtDNA is uniparental and clonal, with genotypic diversity arising from mutation alone. In other eukaryotes, the transmission of mtDNA is biparental or primarily uniparental with the possibility of \"leakage\" from the minority parent. In these cases, heteroplasmy carries the potential for recombination between mtDNAs of different descent. In fungi, such mtDNA recombination has long been documented but only in laboratory experiments and only under conditions in which heteroplasmy is ensured. Despite this experimental evidence, mtDNA recombination has not been to our knowledge documented in a natural population. Because evidence from natural populations is prerequisite to understanding the evolutionary impact of mtDNA recombination, we investigated the possibility of mtDNA recombination in an organism with the demonstrated potential for heteroplasmy in laboratory matings. Using nucleotide sequence data, we report here that the genotypic structure of mtDNA in a natural population of the basidiomycete fungus Armillaria gallica is inconsistent with purely clonal mtDNA evolution and is fully consistent with mtDNA recombination.</em></small><br>[ID: 9448331]"

       "<strong>Molecular genetics of mating recognition in basidiomycete fungi.</strong><br>1998. Casselton LA, Olesnicky NS<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The recognition of compatible mating partners in the basidiomycete fungi requires the coordinated activities of two gene complexes defined as the mating-type genes. One complex encodes members of the homeobox family of transcription factors, which heterodimerize on mating to generate an active transcription regulator. The other complex encodes peptide pheromones and 7-transmembrane receptors that permit intercellular signalling. Remarkably, a single species may have many thousands of cross-compatible mating types because the mating-type genes are multiallelic. Different alleles of both sets of genes are necessary for mating compatibility, and they trigger the initial stages of sexual development--the formation of a specialized filamentous mycelium termed the dikaryon, in which the haploid nuclei remain closely associated in each cell but do not fuse. Three species have been taken as models to describe the molecular structure and organization of the mating-type loci and the genes sequestered within them: the pathogenic smut fungus Ustilago maydis and the mushrooms Coprinus cinereus and Schizophyllum commune. Topics addressed in this review are the roles of the mating-type gene products in regulating sexual development, the molecular basis for multiple mating types, and the molecular interactions that permit different allelic products of the mating type genes to be discriminated. Attention is drawn to the remarkable conservation in the mechanisms that regulate sexual development in basidiomycetes and unicellular ascomycete yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a theme which is developed in the general conclusion to include the filamentous ascomycetes Neurospora crassa and Podospora anserina.</em></small><br>[ID: 9529887]"

Sánchez-Alonso P, Guzmán P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In this study we have established the structure of chromosome ends in the basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis. We isolated and characterized several clones containing telomeric regions and found that as in other organisms, they consist of middle repeated DNA sequences. Two principal types of sequence were found: UTASa was highly conserved in nucleotide sequence and located almost exclusively at the chromosome ends, and UTASb was less conserved in nucleotide sequence than UTASa and found not just at the ends but highly interspersed throughout the genome. Sequence analysis revealed that UTASa encodes an open reading frame containing helicase motifs with the strongest homology to RecQ helicases; these are DNA helicases whose function involves the maintenance of genome stability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in humans, and the suppression of illegitimate recombination in Escherichia coli. Both UTASa and UTASb contain a common region of about 300 bp located immediately adjacent to the telomere repeats that are also found interspersed in the genome. The analysis of the chromosome ends of U. maydis provides information on the general structure of chromosome ends in eukaryotes, and the putative RecQ helicase at UTASa may reveal a novel mechanism for the maintenance of chromosome stability.</em></small><br>[ID: 9539423]"

Dong H, Courchesne W<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes a lethal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Several factors are associated with virulence of this fungus, including its mating type; however, the mechanism by which mating type affects virulence is unknown. C. neoformans is a basidiomycete that exists in two mating types called a and alpha that can fuse to form an a/alpha dikaryon. A mating assay was developed that allowed a quantitative analysis of cryptococcal mating physiology. Interestingly, the efficiency of mating appeared to be dependent on temperature, being highest at 30 degrees C and almost completely absent at 37 degrees C. Thus, while mating type itself may be associated with virulence (which must occur at 37 degrees C), the ability to mate is probably not a virulence factor. Mating efficiency was increased by altering the carbon or nitrogen sources to give so-called starvation media. The addition of various drugs also seemed to alter the frequency of mating, depending on the composition of mating medium. The data suggested that cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP and caffeine increased mating on starvation medium but only cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP stimulated mating on rich medium; caffeine was unable to stimulate mating on rich medium. Aluminium fluoride, an activator of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), was also found to stimulate mating, suggesting the involvement of a G-protein that may regulate the level of cAMP.</em></small><br>[ID: 9639939]"

Hong Y, Cole TE, Brasier CM, Buck KW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The nucleotide sequence (2617 nucleotides) of virus-like double-stranded (ds) RNA 3a in a diseased isolate, Log1/3-8d2 (Ld), of the ascomycete fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi has been determined. One strand of the dsRNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) with the potential to encode a protein of 718 amino acids, and the complementary strand contains two smaller ORFs with the potential to encode proteins of 178 and 182 amino acids, respectively. The large ORF contains 12 UGA codons which code for tryptophan in ascomycete mitochondria and has a codon bias typical of mitochondrial genes, consistent with the localization of Ld dsRNAs within the mitochondria. The amino acid sequence contains motifs characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). This putative RdRp was shown to be related to putative RdRps of mitochondrial dsRNAs of another ascomycete and a basidiomycete fungus and also to a putative RdRp encoded by the mitochondrial genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. In multiple sequence alignments, the fungal mitochondrial dsRNA-encoded RdRp-like proteins formed a cluster, ancestrally related to the RdRps of the yeast 20S and 23S RNA replicons and of the positive-stranded RNA bacteriophages of the Leviviridae family, but distinct from RdRps of other families and genera of fungal RNA viruses and related plant and animal RNA viruses. Northern blot analysis with RNA 3a strand-specific probes indicated that nucleic acid extracts of Ld contain more single-stranded (positive-stranded) RNA than dsRNA, consistent with an evolutionary relationship between RNA 3a and positive-stranded RNA phages.</em></small><br>[ID: 9657003]"

Birch PR, Sims PF, Broda P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>To establish a system for functional analysis of regulatable gene promoters involved in lignocellulose degradation by Phanerochaete chrysosporium, a DNA construct was made in which a minimal promoter region, 410 bp of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the cbhI.1 gene of P. chrysosporium, was fused to the phlR sequence of Streptoallotiechus hindustanus. This construct was used to transform P. chrysosporium to phleomycin resistance. Southern blot analysis revealed that the incoming DNA was maintained extrachromosomally in the transformants. The donor DNA was methylated by the fungus; inhibition of such methylation allowed transformants to be distinguished from 'false-positive' phlR colonies. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of gene expression revealed that the cbhI.1 5' UTR/phlR sequence construct was transcribed, but that an intron within the cbhI.1 promoter was not excised from transcripts of the transforming DNA construct. Moreover, catabolite repression of cbhI.1 expression is relaxed in the construct.

Zhang S, Varma A, Williamson PR<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Transcriptional regulation in mammalian and plant cells is distinguished from fungi by the presence of blocks of multiple interacting DNA binding sites distributed over a relatively large upstream region of genes and the ability to use glutamine-rich enhancers such as Sp1. We offer evidence that the haploid yeast Cryptococcus neoformans contains a virulence gene, CNLAC1, having regulatory properties more similar to mammalian systems than to that of yeast. We used a novel promoter plasmid, pVEW, and electromobility shift assay techniques adapted for the fungus for the first systematic structural and functional study of a 5'-enhancer region of a basidiomycete fungus using the upstream region of CNLAC1. Two groups of interactive enhancer regions, located over a range of 1.5kb from the mRNA start site are involved in CNLAC1 regulation (region 2: -1721 to -1615 and region 7) in addition to a TATA promoter at position -539. Region 2 contains a consensus Sp1 site and region 7 contains a consensus E2F site, each of which shows significant binding to nuclear proteins under derepressed conditions; cooperative binding was also suggested between DNA-binding protein of these sites and those binding nearby CCAAT sequences in each region. Two regions of repression were also evident under derepressed conditions (region 5: -1351 to -1207 and region 8: -991 to -971). Identification of functional Sp1 binding sites and the presence of multiple interactive enhancer sites over a fairly large upstream range suggests that cryptococcal transcriptional regulation contains features often associated with higher eukaryotic regulation. C. neoformans thus may provide a unique system for the study of certain aspects of higher eukaryotic transcription, using yeast genetic approaches. In addition, properties of basidiomycete yeast such as Cryptococcus exemplified in the present study suggest an evolutionary progression in gene regulation within fungi toward properties exhibited in the kingdoms Animalia and Plantae.</em></small><br>[ID: 10023069]"

Gehrig I, Bart HJ, Anke T, Germerdonk R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The influence of the pellet morphology of the basidiomycete Cyathus striatus on the production of the antibiotics striatals A, B, and C was investigated. The main operating parameters in fermenters of different sizes were the tip speed and the volumetric power input. Different methods were developed for quantification of morphological characteristics. The apparent viscosity of the suspension was measured with a cylinder rheometer. Sediment density was measured with a sedimentation apparatus. Particle size distributions were recorded with an image analysis system. By means of the presented measuring methods, morphological characteristics could be determined and enabled an early assessment of the fermentation course and the antibiotics production. During the exponential growth phase of the fungus the relative sediment height correlated with the biomass concentration. The pellet morphology at this stage influenced the later production of striatals. The yield of the striatals was markedly influenced by pellet size and sediment density. Since these morphological characteristics determine the rheological properties of the culture the measurement of the apparent viscosity of the culture in the production phase allowed predictions of the production yield.</em></small><br>[ID: 10099368]"

Kerem Z, hammel, Hammel KE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We have identified key components of the extracellular oxidative system that the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum uses to degrade a recalcitrant polymer, polyethylene glycol, via hydrogen abstraction reactions. G. trabeum produced an extracellular metabolite, 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, and reduced it to 2,5-dimethoxyhydroquinone. In the presence of 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, the fungus also reduced extracellular Fe3+ to Fe2+ and produced extracellular H2O2. Fe3+ reduction and H2O2 formation both resulted from a direct, non-enzymatic reaction between 2,5-dimethoxyhydroquinone and Fe3+. Polyethylene glycol depolymerization by G. trabeum required both 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and Fe3+ and was completely inhibited by catalase. These results provide evidence that G. trabeum uses a hydroquinone-driven Fenton reaction to cleave polyethylene glycol. We propose that similar reactions account for the ability of G. trabeum to attack lignocellulose.</em></small><br>[ID: 10100613]"

Healy V, Doonan S, McCarthy TV<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We have purified an endo-exonuclease from the fruiting body of the basidiomycete fungus Armillaria mellea by using an ethanol fractionation step, followed by two rounds of column chromatography. The enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 17500 Da and was shown to exist as a monomer by gel-filtration analysis. The nuclease was active on both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA but not on RNA. It was optimally active at pH8.5 and also exhibited a significant degree of thermostability. Three bivalent metal ions, Mg2+, Co2+ and Mn2+, acted as cofactors in the catalysis. It was also inhibited by high salt concentrations: activity was completely abolished at 150 mM NaCl. The nuclease possessed both endonuclease activity on supercoiled DNA and a 3'-5' (but not a 5'-3') exonuclease activity. It generated 5'-phosphomonoesters on its products that, after a prolonged incubation, were hydrolysed to a mixture of free mononucleotides and small oligonucleotides ranging in size from two to eight bases. Elucidation of its N-terminal amino acid sequence permitted the cDNA cloning of the A. mellea nuclease via a PCR-based approach. Peptide mapping of the purified enzyme generated patterns consistent with the amino acid sequence coded for by the cloned cDNA. A BLAST search of the SwissProt database revealed that A. mellea nuclease shared significant amino acid similarity with two nucleases from Bacillus subtilis, suggesting that the three might constitute a distinct class of nucleolytic enzymes.</em></small><br>[ID: 10215611]"

Raghukumar C, D'Souza TM, Thorn RG, Reddy CA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A basidiomycetous fungus Flavodon flavus (Klotzsch) Ryvarden (strain 312), isolated from decaying sea grass from a coral lagoon off the west coast of India, mineralized nearly 24% of 14C-labeled synthetic lignin to 14CO2 in 24 days. When grown in low-nitrogen medium (2.4 mM N) this fungus produced three major classes of extracellular lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs): manganese-dependent peroxidase (MNP), lignin peroxidase (LIP), and laccase. Low MNP and laccase activities were seen in high-nitrogen medium (24 mM N), but no LIP activity was seen. In media containing lignocellulosic substrates such as pine, poplar, or sugarcane bagasse as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, relatively high MNP and moderate levels of laccases were seen, but LIP production either was not seen or was minimal. LME production was also seen in media prepared with artificial seawater. Fast protein liquid chromatography and isoelectric focusing resolved LMEs into four isozymes each of MNP and LIP, while laccase isozymes were resolved into two groups, one group containing seven isozymes (pIs 4 to 6) and the other group containing at least three isozymes (pIs < 3). The molecular masses of the different isozymes were 43 to 99 kDa for MNP, 40 and 41.5 kDa for LIP, and 43 and 99 kDa for laccase. F. flavus showed effective degradation of various dye pollutants in media prepared with or without artificial seawater. This is the first report on the production of all three major classes of LMEs by F. flavus and points to the bioremediation potential of this organism in terrestrial as well as marine environments.</em></small><br>[ID: 10224007]"

Krokene P, Christiansen E, Solheim H, Franceschi VR, Berryman AA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees (approximately 16 m high) of a single clone were used to study the effects of fungal infection and wounding on induction of resistance to the bark beetle-associated bluestain fungus Ceratocystis polonica. A dose-response experiment was designed involving three different dosages of fungal (fungus and wound) and sterile agar (wound) pretreatment inoculations (10, 50, or 100 inoculations/m(2) on the stem between 0.8 and 2.0 m high). Three weeks after pretreatment, trees were challenged with a massive C. polonica inoculation (400 inoculations/m(2)). Control trees that received no pretreatment were heavily colonized and killed by the challenge inoculation. The high and medium fungal pretreatments reduced subsequent fungal colonization success by 76% to 97% relative to the control, and fungal pretreatments protected the trees much more efficiently than sterile agar pretreatments. The protection was demonstrated to be local and not systemic in a subsequent experiment, where trees were pretreated with the medium fungal dosage on the lower bole and challenge inoculated further up the stem. Protection was also demonstrated to be pathogen nonspecific, as trees that had been pretreated with a medium dosage of the root rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum showed enhanced resistance to challenge inoculation with C. polonica.</em></small><br>[ID: 10517848]"

Sethuraman A, Akin DE, Eriksson KE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Production of ligninolytic enzymes and degradation of 14C-ring labeled synthetic lignin by the white-rot fungus Cyathus stercoreus ATCC 36910 were determined under a variety of conditions. The highest mineralization rate for 14C dehydrogenative polymerizates (DHP; 38% 14CO2 after 30 days) occurred with 1 mM ammonium tartrate as nitrogen source and 1% glucose as additional carbon source, but levels of extracellular laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) were low. In contrast, 10 mM ammonium tartrate with 1% glucose gave low mineralization rates (10% 14CO2 after 30 days) but higher levels of laccase and manganese peroxidase. Lignin peroxidase was not produced by C. stercoreus under any of the studied conditions. Mn(II) at 11 ppm gave a higher rate of 14C DHP mineralization than 0.3 or 40 ppm, but the highest manganese peroxidase level was obtained with Mn(II) at 40 ppm. Cultivation in aerated static flasks gave rise to higher levels of both laccase and manganese peroxidase compared to the levels in shake cultures. 3,4-Dimethoxycinnamic acid at 500 microM concentration was the most effective inducer of laccase of those tested. The purified laccase was a monomeric glycoprotein having an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa, as determined by calibrated gel filtration chromatography. The pH optimum and isoelectric point of the purified laccase were 4.8 and 3.5, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of C. stercoreus laccase showed close homology to the N-terminal sequences determined from other basidiomycete laccases. Information on C. stercoreus, whose habitat and physiological requirements for lignin degradation differ from many other white-rot fungi, expands the possibilities for industrial application of biological systems for lignin degradation and removal in biopulping and biobleaching processes.</em></small><br>[ID: 10570816]"

Laccase levels observed in high-nitrogen (HN; 24 mM N) shaken cultures were much greater than those seen in low-nitrogen (2.4 mM N), malt extract, or wood-grown cultures and those reported for most other white rot fungi to date. Laccase production was readily seen in cultures grown with pine or poplar (100-mesh-size ground wood) as the sole carbon and energy source. Cultures containing both pine and poplar showed 5- to 10-fold-higher levels of laccase than cultures containing pine or poplar alone. Since syringyl units are structural components important in poplar lignin and other hardwoods but much less so in pine lignin and other softwoods, pine cultures were supplemented with syringic acid, and this resulted in laccase levels comparable to those seen in pine-plus-poplar cultures. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of concentrated extracellular culture fluid from HN cultures showed two laccase activity bands (M(r) of 40,000 and 66, 000), whereas isoelectric focusing revealed five major laccase activity bands with estimated pIs of 3.0, 4.25, 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1. Low levels of MnP activity ( approximately 100 U/liter) were detected in poplar-grown cultures but not in cultures grown with pine, with pine plus syringic acid, or in HN medium. No LiP activity was seen in any of the media tested; however, probing the genomic DNA with the LiP cDNA (CLG4) from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium showed distinct hybridization bands suggesting the presence of lip-like sequences in G. lucidum.</em></small><br>[ID: 10583981]"

Basse CW, Stumpferl S, Kahmann R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The phytopathogenic basidiomycete Ustilago maydis requires its host plant, maize, for completion of its sexual cycle. To investigate the molecular events during infection, we used differential display to identify plant-induced U. maydis genes. We describe the U. maydis gene mig1 (for \"maize-induced gene\"), which is not expressed during yeast-like growth of the fungus, is weakly expressed during filamentous growth in axenic culture, but is extensively upregulated during plant infection. mig1 encodes a small, highly charged protein of unknown function which contains a functional N-terminal secretion sequence and is not essential for pathogenic development. Adjacent to mig1 is a second gene (mdu1) related to mig1, which appears to result from a gene duplication. mig1 gene expression during the infection cycle was assessed by fusing the promoter to eGFP. Expression of mig1 was absent in hyphae growing on the leaf surface but was detected after penetration and remained high during subsequent proliferation of the fungus until teliospore formation. Successive deletions as well as certain internal deletions in the mig1 promoter conferred elevated levels of reporter gene expression during growth in axenic culture, indicative of negative regulation. During fungal growth in planta, sequence elements between positions -148 and -519 in the mig1 promoter were specifically required for high levels of induction, illustrating additional positive control. We discuss the potential applications of mig1 for the identification of inducing compounds and the respective regulatory genes.</em></small><br>[ID: 10594035]"

The 5' ends of the coding strands of dsRNA 1 and dsRNA 2 are highly conserved (100% identity over 47 bases), and contain inverted repeats capable of forming stable stem-loop structures. Analysis of the coding potential of each of the two segments showed that dsRNAs 1 and 2 could code for polypeptides of 730 aa (bases 86-2275; molecular mass 86 kDa) and 683 aa (bases 79-2130; molecular mass 76 kDa), respectively.

Palmieri G, Giardina P, Bianco C, Fontanella B, Sannia G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Pleurotus ostreatus is a white rot basidiomycete that produces several extracellular laccase isoenzymes, including phenol oxidase A1b (POXA1b), POXA2, and POXC. POXC was the most abundant isoenzyme produced under all of the growth conditions examined in this study. Copper was the most efficient inducer of laccase activity among the putative inducers tested. The amounts of all of the previously described laccase isoenzymes increased substantially in copper-supplemented cultures. Under these conditions expression of POX isoenzymes was regulated at the level of gene transcription. It is worth noting that poxa1b mRNA was the most abundant induced transcript at all of the growth times analyzed, and the amount of this mRNA increased until day 7. The discrepancy between the poxa1b transcript and protein amounts can be explained by the presence of a high level of the protein in P. ostreatus cellular extract, which indicated that the POXA1b isoenzyme could be inefficiently secreted and/or that its physiological activity could occur inside the cell or on the cell wall. Moreover, the POXA1b isoenzyme behaved uniquely, as its activity was maximal on the second day of growth and then decreased. An analysis performed with protease inhibitors revealed that the loss of extracellular POXA1b activity could have been due to the presence of specific proteases secreted into the copper-containing culture medium that affected the extracellular POXA1b isoenzyme.</em></small><br>[ID: 10698752]"

From a three-step chromatographic procedure, we purified a major isoform to homogeneity. The gene encodes a monomeric glycoprotein of approximately 63 kDa, with a 3.6 isoelectric point, that contains 12% carbohydrate. Spectroscopic analysis of the purified enzyme (UV/visible and electron paramagnetic resonance, atomic absorption) confirmed that it belongs to the \"blue copper oxidase\" family.

The activity levels of specific lignin-degrading enzymes and cellulases, as well as the rate of wood degradation, also were examined. The fungus secreted a low-molecular-weight substance (M(r) 1000-5000) that catalyzed a redox reaction between molecular oxygen and an electron donor, to produce the hydroxyl radical via hydrogen peroxide. During wood decay, T. versicolor also produced significant amounts of laccase and lignin peroxidase, carboxymethyl cellulase, and Avicelase. The roles of the hydroxyl radical, phenol oxidases, and cellulases in wood degradation by white-rot fungi are discussed.

Yagüe S, Terrón MC, González T, Zapico E, Bocchini P, Galletti GC, González AE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Some fractions of beer-factory wastewaters represent an important environmental concern owing to their high content of polyphenols and dark-brown color. The capacity of Coriolopsis gallica to preferentially degrade lignin has been successfully applied in our laboratory to the biotreatment and decolorization of paper-industry effluents. In this work, the ability of this white-rot fungus to degrade high-tannin-containing wastewaters is evaluated. Under all the conditions studied, effluent decolorization and chemical oxygen demand reduction achieved by C. gallica at day 12 of incubation were close to 50 and 65%, respectively. No adhesion of dark color to the fungal mycelium was observed suggesting that decolorization could be ascribed to C. gallica degradation systems. Mycelium dry-weight values showed that C. gallica is tolerant to relatively high tannin content present in the effluent samples. In the sample containing the highest effluent concentration (60% v/v), dry-weight values suggested an inhibition of fungal growth at day 6 of incubation and a further adaptation of the fungus to the stressing tannin effect at day 12 of fungal treatment. Pyrolysis/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry results showed a decrease of polyphenols pyrolysis products, mainly phenol and guaiacol, with the incubation time. All these results indicate the potential use of C. gallica in bioremediation of tannin-containing industrial wastewaters and in other applications where a reduction in polyphenols content is required.</em></small><br>[ID: 10825255]"

Kües U<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Coprinus cinereus has two main types of mycelia, the asexual monokaryon and the sexual dikaryon, formed by fusion of compatible monokaryons. Syngamy (plasmogamy) and karyogamy are spatially and temporally separated, which is typical for basidiomycetous fungi. This property of the dikaryon enables an easy exchange of nuclear partners in further dikaryotic-monokaryotic and dikaryotic-dikaryotic mycelial fusions. Fruiting bodies normally develop on the dikaryon, and the cytological process of fruiting-body development has been described in its principles. Within the specialized basidia, present within the gills of the fruiting bodies, karyogamy occurs in a synchronized manner. It is directly followed by meiosis and by the production of the meiotic basidiospores. The synchrony of karyogamy and meiosis has made the fungus a classical object to study meiotic cytology and recombination. Several genes involved in these processes have been identified. Both monokaryons and dikaryons can form multicellular resting bodies (sclerotia) and different types of mitotic spores, the small uninucleate aerial oidia, and, within submerged mycelium, the large thick-walled chlamydospores. The decision about whether a structure will be formed is made on the basis of environmental signals (light, temperature, humidity, and nutrients). Of the intrinsic factors that control development, the products of the two mating type loci are most important. Mutant complementation and PCR approaches identified further genes which possibly link the two mating-type pathways with each other and with nutritional regulation, for example with the cAMP signaling pathway. Among genes specifically expressed within the fruiting body are those for two galectins, beta-galactoside binding lectins that probably act in hyphal aggregation. These genes serve as molecular markers to study development in wild-type and mutant strains. The isolation of genes for potential non-DNA methyltransferases, needed for tissue formation within the fruiting body, promises the discovery of new signaling pathways, possibly involving secondary fungal metabolites.</em></small><br>[ID: 10839819]"

Sia RA, Lengeler KB, Heitman J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic human pathogenic fungus with a defined sexual cycle. Clinical and environmental isolates of C. neoformans are haploid, and the diploid stage of the lifecycle is thought to be transient and unstable. In contrast, we find that diploid strains are readily obtained following genetic crosses of congenic MATalpha and MATa strains. At 37 degrees C, the diploid strains grow as yeast cells with a single nucleus that is larger than a haploid nucleus, contains a 2n content of DNA by FACS analysis, and is heterozygous for the MATalpha and MATa loci. At 24 degrees C, these diploid self-fertile strains filament and sporulate, producing recombinant haploid progeny in which meiotic segregation has occurred. In contrast to dikaryotic filament cells that are typically linked by fused clamp connections during mating, self-fertile diploid strains produce monokaryotic filament cells with unfused clamp connections. We also show that these diploid strains can be transformed and sporulated and that an integrated selectable marker segregates in a mendelian fashion. The diploid state could play novel roles in the lifecycle and virulence of the organism and can be exploited for the analysis of essential genes. Finally, the observation that dimorphism is thermally regulated suggests similarities between the lifecycle of C. neoformans and other thermally dimorphic human pathogenic fungi, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Sporothrix schenkii.</em></small><br>[ID: 10882532]"

Jargeat P, Gay G, Debaud JC, Marmeisse R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ectomycorrhizal fungi contribute to the nitrogen nutrition of their host plants, but no information is available on the molecular control of their nitrogen metabolism. The cloning and pattern of transcriptional regulation of two nitrite reductase genes of the symbiotic basidiomycete Hebeloma cylindrosporum are presented. The genomic copy of one of these genes (nar1) was entirely sequenced; the coding region is interrupted by 12 introns. The nar1 gene, which is transcribed and codes for a putative 908-amino acid polypeptide complemented nitrate reductase-deficient mutants of H. cylindrosporum upon transformation, thus demonstrating that the gene is functional. The second gene (nar2), for which no mRNA transcripts were detected, is considered to be an ancestral, non-functional duplication of nar1. In a 462-nt partial sequence of nar2 two introns were identified at positions identical to those of introns 8 and 9 of nar1, although their respective nucleotide sequences were highly divergent; the exon sequences were much more conserved. In wild-type strains, transcription of nar1 is repressed in the presence of a high concentration of ammonium. High levels of transcription are observed in the presence of either very low nitrogen concentrations or high concentrations of nitrate or organic N sources such as urea, glycine or serine. This indicates that in H. cylindrosporum, in contrast to all nitrophilous organisms studied so far, an exogenous supply of nitrate is not required to induce transcription of a nitrate reductase gene. In contrast, repression by ammonium suggests the existence of a wide-domain regulatory gene, as already characterized in ascomycete species.</em></small><br>[ID: 10954080]"

The results indicate that glucose and fructose but not cellobiose or sucrose supported growth of these fungi when used as sole carbon source. Particularly for P-types and F. avenaceum, however, the utilization of cellobiose and sucrose was considerably enhanced by several fold in the presence of ethanol. In addition, key plant cell wall phenolics (ferulic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid) at 0.025% inhibited growth of the test fungi. But this toxicity was reversed in the presence of exogenously added cell wall sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose, cellobiose) except for the P-types where sucrose addition was apparently slightly effective. Similarly, ethanol whether alone or in combination with the phenolics was poorly utilized except for F. avenaceum. The importance of these results in understanding factors influencing growth and development during pathogenesis of the necrotrophs on their conifer hosts is discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 10957955]"

Kaneko S, Shishido K<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We have previously isolated the uck1 gene encoding UMP-CMP kinase from the basidiomycete Lentinus edodes (Kaneko et al., 1998). It was shown to be most actively transcribed in hymenophores of mature fruiting bodies of L. edodes. The reduction of NDPs produced by the nucleoside monophosphate kinase to dNDPs has been known to be catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) which consists of a heterodimer of large and small subunits. So we attempted to isolate the L. edodes cDNA(s) of RNR and study the expression in L. edodes of the corresponding gene(s), resulting in an isolation of the small subunit cDNA from a mature fruiting-body cDNA library of the fungus. This cDNA, named Le.rnr2c, was shown to encode a 418 amino acids (aa) protein, named Le.RNR2, of which the deduced aa sequence shows an overall identity of 71.9% to that of Schizosaccharomyces pombe RNR small subunit. The Le.rnr2 gene was found to be most actively transcribed in hymenophores of mature fruiting body of L. edodes. The in situ RNA-RNA hybridization analysis showed the presence of markedly large amount of the Le.rnr2 transcript in both hymenium and outer region of trama in the hymenophore. The same experiment was done for the uck1 gene, obtaining a similar result. The hymenium contains many basidia in which fusion of two nuclei, meiosis, replication, etc. essential for production of basidiospores occur. The outer region of trama is the region branching out into subhymenium. These imply that Le.rnr2 gene (and uck1 gene) play a role mainly in the nucleotide biosynthesis essential both for production of basidiospores and for divergence of trama cells into subhymenium cells in the hymenophore.</em></small><br>[ID: 11179666]"

Takaku T, Kimura Y, Okuda H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The Basidiomycete fungus Agaricus blazei Murill has traditionally been used as a health food for the prevention of cancer, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis and chronic hepatitis. In the present study, we examined the antitumor activities of various substances isolated from the lipid fraction of A. blazei. Tumor growth was retarded by the oral administration of the lipid fraction extracted from A. blazei with a chloroform/methanol mixture in sarcoma 180-bearing mice. The substance with the antitumor activity in the lipid fraction was isolated via silica gel column chromatography, eluted with an acetonitrile/methanol (3:2) mixture and identified as ergosterol by direct comparison of the (1)H NMR and mass spectrometry spectral data of an authentic sample. The oral administration of ergosterol to sarcoma 180-bearing mice significantly reduced tumor growth at doses of 400 and 800 mg/kg administered for 20 d without side effects, such as the decreases in body, epididymal adipose tissue, thymus, and spleen weights and leukocyte numbers induced by cancer chemotherapy drugs. Ergosterol had no cytotoxicity against tumor cells. To clarify the antitumor activity of ergosterol, we examined the effects of ergosterol on tumor-induced angiogenesis using two in vivo models. Intraperitoneal administration of ergosterol at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg for 5 consecutive d inhibited the neovascularization induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cell-packed chambers, suggesting that either ergosterol or its metabolites may be involved in the inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization. Therefore, we further examined the inhibitory effects of ergosterol on Matrigel-induced neovascularization. Female C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously inoculated with Matrigel containing acidic fibroblast growth factor and heparin with or without ergosterol. Ergosterol inhibited the Matrigel-induced neovascularization, suggesting that ergosterol directly inhibits Matrigel-induced neovascularization. From these results, it seems likely that the antitumor activity of ergosterol might be due to direct inhibition of angiogenesis induced by solid tumors. This is the first report of ergosterol as an antiangiogenic substance.</em></small><br>[ID: 11340091]"

Jensen KA Jr, Houtman CJ, Ryan ZC, Hammel KE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum uses an extracellular hydroquinone-quinone redox cycle to reduce Fe(3+) and produce H(2)O(2). These reactions generate extracellular Fenton reagent, which enables G. trabeum to degrade a wide variety of organic compounds. We found that G. trabeum secreted two quinones, 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (2,5-DMBQ) and 4,5-dimethoxy-1,2-benzoquinone (4,5-DMBQ), that underwent iron-dependent redox cycling. Experiments that monitored the iron- and quinone-dependent cleavage of polyethylene glycol by G. trabeum showed that 2,5-DMBQ was more effective than 4,5-DMBQ in supporting extracellular Fenton chemistry. Two factors contributed to this result. First, G. trabeum reduced 2,5-DMBQ to 2,5-dimethoxyhydroquinone (2,5-DMHQ) much more rapidly than it reduced 4,5-DMBQ to 4,5-dimethoxycatechol (4,5-DMC). Second, although both hydroquinones reduced ferric oxalate complexes, the predominant form of Fe(3+) in G. trabeum cultures, the 2,5-DMHQ-dependent reaction reduced O(2) more rapidly than the 4,5-DMC-dependent reaction. Nevertheless, both hydroquinones probably contribute to the extracellular Fenton chemistry of G. trabeum, because 2,5-DMHQ by itself is an efficient reductant of 4,5-DMBQ.</em></small><br>[ID: 11375184]"

Guidot A, Debaud JC, Marmeisse R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Population studies of ectomycorrhizal fungal species have largely relied upon fruit body (the reproductive organ) sampling. Analysis of the fruit bodies alone supposes that they reflect the present and spatial organization of all below-ground genets (mycorrhizas and extramatrical mycelia). The relation between fruit bodies and ectomycorrhizas was investigated for the basidiomycete agaric Hebeloma cylindrosporum in four Pinus pinaster stands in south-west France. Genet identification was based on the comparison of polymorphisms within a hypervariable segment of the ribosomal intergenic spacer amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a H. cylindrosporum species-specific primer. Mycorrhizas were sorted from soil samples collected underneath patches of fruit bodies or patches where fruit bodies had or had not been observed during the years prior to mycorrhiza collection. On average 65% of the 1026 mycorrhizas collected underneath fruit bodies were formed by H. cylindrosporum, whereas only 2% of the 954 collected in places from where fruit bodies were absent were formed by this species. All genotypes identified above ground were also identified below ground. In patches where one genotype formed all or more than 90% of the fruit bodies, the same genotype formed all or a large majority of the mycorrhizas. In patches occupied by several different fruiting genotypes, additional nonfruiting ones could be present on the root systems. In all cases, the mycorrhizas of one genotype were found no more than 10-20 cm away from its corresponding fruit bodies, and fruit body disappearance at a given place was associated with the disappearance of the corresponding mycorrhizas within 1 year. Although there was not a strict coincidence between the total numbers of genets present below ground and of those forming fruit bodies, fruit body analysis for H. cylindrosporum appears to reflect both the genetic diversity and the spatial structure of its below-ground populations. The results obtained also illustrate the rapid turnover of ectomycorrhizal fungal species on the root systems in the absence of any obvious major disturbance of the ecosystem.</em></small><br>[ID: 11380871]"

When lambda phage DNA was added to a transformation mixture containing protoplasts and CbxR vector plasmid, an increased number of drug-resistant transformants was observed on a screening plate containing 2 microg carboxin/ml. The highest efficiency (about 200 transformants/microg vector plasmid) was obtained by the addition of heat-denatured lambda DNA, which gave yields approximately 50-fold higher than the control experiment without a carrier DNA.

Soden DM, Dobson ADW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Four laccase isozyme genes, Psc lac1, 2, 3 and 4 have been cloned from the edible mushroom, Pleurotus sajor-caju. The genes display a high degree of homology with other basidiomycete laccases (55-99%) at the amino acid level. Of the laccase genes isolated, Psc lac1 and 4 displayed the highest degree of similarity (85% at the amino acid level), while Psc lac3 showed the highest degree of divergence, exhibiting only 52-57% amino acid similarity to the other PL: sajor-caju laccase gene sequences. Laccase activity in PL: sajor-caju is affected by nutrient nitrogen and carbon, and by the addition of copper and manganese to the growth medium. In addition, 2,5-xylidine, ferulic acid, veratric acid and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole induced laccase activity in the fungus. Induction of individual laccase isozyme genes by carbon, nitrogen, copper, manganese and the two aromatic compounds, 2,5-xylidine and ferulic acid, occurred at the level of gene transcription. While Psc lac3 transcript levels appeared to be constitutively expressed, transcript levels for the other laccase isozyme genes, lac1, 2 and 4, were differentially regulated under the conditions tested.</em></small><br>[ID: 11429453]"

Larraya LM, Pérez G, Iribarren I, Blanco JA, Alfonso M, Pisabarro AG, Ramírez L<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The edible fungus Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) is an industrially produced heterothallic homobasidiomycete whose mating is controlled by a bifactorial tetrapolar genetic system. Two mating loci (matA and matB) control different steps of hyphal fusion, nuclear migration, and nuclear sorting during the onset and progress of the dikaryotic growth. Previous studies have shown that the segregation of the alleles present at the matB locus differs from that expected for a single locus because (i) new nonparental B alleles appeared in the progeny and (ii) there was a distortion in the segregation of the genomic regions close to this mating locus. In this study, we pursued these observations by using a genetic approach based on the identification of molecular markers linked to the matB locus that allowed us to dissect it into two genetically linked subunits (matBalpha and matBbeta) and to correlate the presence of specific matBalpha and matA alleles with differences in monokaryotic growth rate. The availability of these molecular markers and the mating type dependence of growth rate in monokaryons can be helpful for marker-assisted selection of fast-growing monokaryons to be used in the construction of dikaryons able to colonize the substrate faster than the competitors responsible for reductions in the industrial yield of this fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 11472908]"

Mayorga ME, Gold SE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The Basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis causes corn smut disease and alternates between a budding haploid saprophyte and a filamentous dikaryotic pathogen. Previous work demonstrated that haploid adenylate cyclase (uac1) mutants display a constitutively filamentous phenotype. Suppressor mutants of a uac1 disruption strain, named ubc for Ustilago bypass of cyclase, no longer require cAMP for the budding morphology. The ubc2 gene was isolated by complementation and is required for filamentous growth. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by ubc2 shows localized homology to Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM), Ras Association (RA) and Src homology 3 (SH3) protein-protein interaction domains. A K78E missense mutation within the SAM domain, revealed a genetic interaction between ubc2 and ubc4, a pheromone-responsive MAP kinase kinase kinase. This indicates involvement of ubc2 in the pheromone-responsive MAP kinase cascade and ubc2 is required for pheromone-responsive morphogenesis. The ubc2 gene is a critical virulence factor. Thus, ubc2 encodes a putative novel adaptor protein that may act directly upstream of the pheromone-responsive MAP kinase cascade in U. maydis.</em></small><br>[ID: 11580841]"

Nidetzky B, Eis C<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungal trehalose phosphorylase is classified as a family 4 glucosyltransferase that catalyses the reversible phosphorolysis of alpha,alpha-trehalose with net retention of anomeric configuration. Glucosyl transfer to and from phosphate takes place by the partly rate-limiting interconversion of ternary enzyme-substrate complexes formed from binary enzyme-phosphate and enzyme-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl phosphate adducts respectively. To advance a model of the chemical mechanism of trehalose phosphorylase, we performed a steady-state kinetic study with the purified enzyme from the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune by using alternative substrates, inhibitors and combinations thereof in pairs as specific probes of substrate-binding recognition and transition-state structure. Orthovanadate is a competitive inhibitor against phosphate and alpha-d-glucopyranosyl phosphate, and binds 3 x 10(4)-fold tighter (K(i) approximately 1 microM) than phosphate. Structural alterations of d-glucose at C-2 and O-5 are tolerated by the enzyme at subsite +1. They lead to parallel effects of approximately the same magnitude (slope=1.14; r(2)=0.98) on the reciprocal catalytic efficiency for reverse glucosyl transfer [log (K(m)/k(cat))] and the apparent affinity of orthovanadate determined in the presence of the respective glucosyl acceptor (log K(i)). An adduct of orthovanadate and the nucleophile/leaving group bound at subsite +1 is therefore the true inhibitor and displays partial transition state analogy. Isofagomine binds to subsite -1 in the enzyme-phosphate complex with a dissociation constant of 56 microM and inhibits trehalose phosphorylase at least 20-fold better than 1-deoxynojirimycin. The specificity of the reversible azasugars inhibitors would be explained if a positive charge developed on C-1 rather than O-5 in the proposed glucosyl cation-like transition state of the reaction. The results are discussed in the context of alpha-retaining glucosyltransferase mechanisms that occur with and without a beta-glucosyl enzyme intermediate.</em></small><br>[ID: 11736665]"

McClelland CM, Fu J, Woodlee GL, Seymour TS, Wickes BL<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cryptococcus neoformans is a heterothallic basidiomycete with two mating types, MATa and MATalpha. The mating pathway of this fungus has a number of conserved genes, including a MATalpha-specific pheromone (MFalpha1). A modified differential display strategy was used to identify a gene encoding the MATa pheromone. The gene, designated MFa1, is 42 amino acids in length and contains a conserved farnesylation motif. MFa1 is present in three linked copies that span a 20-kb fragment of MATa-specific DNA and maps to the MAT-containing chromosome. Transformation studies showed that MFa1 induced filament formation only in MATalpha cells, demonstrating that MFa1 is functionally conserved. Sequence analysis of the predicted Mfa1 and Mfalpha1 proteins revealed that, in contrast to other fungi such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the C. neoformans pheromone genes are structurally and functionally conserved. However, unlike the MFalpha1 gene, which is found in MATalpha strains of both varieties of C. neoformans, MFa1 is specific for the neoformans variety of C. neoformans.</em></small><br>[ID: 11901112]"

To better understand these processes, we studied the enzymatic composition of the ligninolytic system of this fungus. Since laccase was the sole ligninolytic enzyme found, we paid attention to the oxidative capabilities of this enzyme that would allow its participation in the mentioned degradative processes. We purified two laccase isoenzymes to electrophoretic homogeneity from copper-induced cultures. Both enzymes are monomeric proteins, with the same molecular mass (66 kDa), isoelectric point (3.9), N-linked carbohydrate content (9%), pH optima of 3.0 on 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) and 2.5 on 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), absorption spectrum, and N-terminal amino acid sequence. They oxidized 4-anisidine and numerous phenolic compounds, including methoxyphenols, hydroquinones, and lignin-derived aldehydes and acids. Phenol red, an unusual substrate of laccase due to its high redox potential, was also oxidized. The highest enzyme affinity and efficiency were obtained with ABTS and, among phenolic compounds, with 2,6-dimethoxyhydroquinone (DBQH(2)). The presence of ABTS in the laccase reaction expanded the substrate range of C. rigida laccases to nonphenolic compounds and that of MBQH(2) extended the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes to the production of H(2)O(2), the oxidation of Mn(2+), the reduction of Fe(3+), and the generation of hydroxyl radicals. These results confirm the participation of laccase in the production of oxygen free radicals, suggesting novel uses of this enzyme in degradative processes.</em></small><br>[ID: 11916665]"

Hyde GJ, Davies D, Cole L, Ashford AE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Tubule formation is a widespread feature of the endomembrane system of eukaryotic cells, serving as an alternative to the better-known transport process of vesicular shuttling. In filamentous fungi, tubule formation by vacuoles is particularly pronounced, but little is known of its regulation. Using the hyphae of the basidiomycete Pisolithus tinctorius as our test system, we have investigated the effects of four drugs whose modulation, in animal cells, of the tubule/vesicle equilibrium is believed to be due to the altered activity of a GTP-binding protein (GTP gamma S, GDP beta S, aluminium fluoride, and Brefeldin A). In Pisolithus tinctorius, GTP gamma S, a non-hydrolysable form of GTP, strongly promoted vacuolar tubule formation in the tip cell and next four cells. The effects of GTP gamma S could be antagonised by pre-treatment of hyphae with GDP beta S, a non-phosphorylatable form of GDP. These results support the idea that a GTP-binding protein plays a regulatory role in vacuolar tubule formation. This could be a dynamin-like GTP-ase, since GTP gamma S-stimulated tubule formation has only been reported previously in cases where a dynamin is involved. Treatment with aluminium fluoride stimulated vacuolar tubule formation at a distance from the tip cell, but NaF controls indicated that this was not a GTP-binding-protein specific effect. Brefeldin A antagonised GTP gamma S, and inhibited tubule formation in the tip cell. Given that Brefeldin A also affects the ER and Golgi bodies of Pisolithus tinctorius, as shown previously, it is not clear yet whether the effects of Brefeldin A on the vacuole system are direct or indirect.</em></small><br>[ID: 11921170]"

Ichinose H, Nakamizo M, Wariishi H, Tanaka H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The fungal conversions of sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds were investigated using the lignin-degrading basidiomycete Coriolus versicolor. The fungus metabolized a series of sulfur compounds--25 structurally related thiophene derivatives--via several different pathways. Under primary metabolic conditions, C. versicolor utilized thiophenes, such as 2-hydroxymethyl-, 2-formyl-, and 2-carboxyl-thiophenes, as a nutrient sulfur source for growth; thus, the fungus degraded these compounds more effectively in a non-sulfur-containing medium than in conventional medium. The product analysis revealed that several redox reactions, decarboxylation reactions, and C-S cleavage reactions were involved in the fungal conversion of non-aromatic thiophenes. On the other hand, benzothiophene (BT) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) skeletons were converted to water-soluble products. All the products and metabolic intermediates were more hydrophilic than the starting substrates. These metabolic actions seemed to be a chemical stress response against exogenously added xenobiotics. These metabolic reactions were optimized under ligninolytic conditions, also suggesting the occurrence of a fungal xenobiotic response. Furthermore, the fungus converted a series of BTs and DBTs via several different pathways, which seemed to be controlled by the chemical structure of the substrates. DBT, 4-methylDBT, 4, 6-dimethylDBT, 2-methylBT, and 7-methylBT were immediately oxidized to their S-oxides. BTs and DBTs with the hydroxymethyl substituent were converted to their xylosides without S-oxidation. Those with carboxyl and formyl substituents were reduced to form a hydroxymethyl group, then xylosidated. These observations strongly suggested the involvement of a fungal substrate-recognition and metabolic response mechanism in the metabolism of sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds by C. versicolor.</em></small><br>[ID: 11954800]"

Tanabe Y, Yokota A, Sugiyama J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The origins of fungal group I introns within nuclear small-subunit (nSSU) rDNA are enigmatic. This is partly because they have never been reported in basal fungal phyla (Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota), which are hypothesized to be ancestral to derived phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). Here we report group I introns from the nSSU rDNA of two zygomycete fungi, Zoophagus insidians (Zoopagales) and Coemansia mojavensis (Kickxellales). Secondary structure analyses predicted that both introns belong to the IC1 subgroup and that they are distantly related to each other, which is also suggested by different insertion sites. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that the IC1 intron of Z. insidians is closely related to the IC1 intron inserted in the LSU rDNA of the basidiomycete fungus Clavicorona taxophila, which strongly suggests interphylum horizontal transfer. The IC1 intron of C. mojavensis has a low phylogenetic affinity to other fungal IC1 introns inserted into site 943 of nSSU rDNA (relative to E. coli 16S rDNA). It is noteworthy that this intron contains a putative ORF containing a His-Cys box motif in the antisense strand, a hallmark for nuclear-encoded homing endonucleases. Overall, molecular phylogenetic analyses do not support the placement of these two introns in basal fungal IC1 intron lineages. This result leads to the suggestion that fungal IC1 introns might have invaded or been transferred laterally after the divergence of the four major fungal phyla.</em></small><br>[ID: 11965441]"

The enzyme comprises two identical 22-kDa subunits, each with one molecule of flavin mononucleotide. It is specific for NADH as the reductant and uses the quinones produced by G. trabeum (2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone and 4,5-dimethoxy-1,2-benzoquinone) as electron acceptors. The affinity of the reductase for these quinones is so high that precise kinetic parameters were not obtainable, but it is clear that k(cat)/K(m) for the quinones is greater than 10(8) M(-1) s(-1). The reductase is encoded by a gene with substantial similarity to NAD(P)H:quinone reductase genes from other fungi. The G. trabeum quinone reductase may function in quinone detoxification, a role often proposed for these enzymes, but we hypothesize that the fungus has recruited it to drive extracellular oxyradical production.</em></small><br>[ID: 12039722]"

Williams HL, Tang Y, Hintz WE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Chondrostereum purpureum produces several plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, including endopolygalacturonase (endoPG). Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed according to conserved regions of endoPG genes from various fungi, plants, and bacteria and used to amplify members of this gene family from C. purpureum. Four different amplification products showed significant similarity to known endoPGs and were used as hybridization probes to screen a library of genomic DNA sequences and to retrieve five full-length endoPG genes (epgA, epgB1, epgB2, epgC, and epgD). The identities between the deduced polypeptides for epgA, epgB1, epgC, and epgD ranged from 61.8 to 80.0%, while the deduced polypeptides for epgB1 and epgB2 shared 97.1% identity. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the duplication of existing endoPG genes occurred after the divergence of the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.

Bending GD, Friloux M, Walker A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The capacity of nine species of white rot fungus from a variety of basidiomycete orders to degrade contrasting mono-aromatic pesticides was investigated. There was no relationship between degradation of the dye Poly R-478, a presumptive test for ligninolytic potential, and degradation of the highly available pesticides diuron, metalaxyl, atrazine or terbuthylazine in liquid culture. However, there were significant positive correlations between the rates of degradation of the different pesticides. Greatest degradation of all the pesticides was achieved by Coriolus versicolor, Hypholoma fasciculare and Stereum hirsutum. After 42 days, maximum degradation of diuron, atrazine and terbuthylazine was above 86%, but for metalaxyl less than 44%. When grown in the organic matrix of an on-farm \"biobed\" pesticide remediation system, relative degradation rates of the highly available pesticides by C. versicolor, H. fasciculare and S. hirsutum showed some differences to those in liquid culture. While H. fasciculare and C. versicolor were able to degrade about a third of the poorly available compound chlorpyrifos in biobed matrix after 42 days, S. hirsutum, which was the most effective degrader of the available pesticides, showed little capacity to degrade the compound.</em></small><br>[ID: 12076788]"

Moncalvo JM, Vilgalys R, Redhead SA, Johnson JE, James TY, Catherine Aime M, Hofstetter V, Verduin SJ, Larsson E, Baroni TJ, Greg Thorn R, Jacobsson S, Clémençon H, Miller OK Jr<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>This study provides a first broad systematic treatment of the euagarics as they have recently emerged in phylogenetic systematics. The sample consists of 877 homobasidiomycete taxa and includes approximately one tenth (ca. 700 species) of the known number of species of gilled mushrooms that were traditionally classified in the order Agaricales. About 1000 nucleotide sequences at the 5(') end of the nuclear large ribosomal subunit gene (nLSU) were produced for each taxon. Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequence data employed unequally weighted parsimony and bootstrap methods. Clades revealed by the analyses support the recognition of eight major groups of homobasidiomycetes that cut across traditional lines of classification, in agreement with other recent phylogenetic studies. Gilled fungi comprise the majority of species in the euagarics clade. However, the recognition of a monophyletic euagarics results in the exclusion from the clade of several groups of gilled fungi that have been traditionally classified in the Agaricales and necessitates the inclusion of several clavaroid, poroid, secotioid, gasteroid, and reduced forms that were traditionally classified in other basidiomycete orders. A total of 117 monophyletic groups (clades) of euagarics can be recognized on the basis on nLSU phylogeny. Though many clades correspond to traditional taxonomic groups, many do not. Newly discovered phylogenetic affinities include for instance relationships of the true puffballs (Lycoperdales) with Agaricaceae, of Panellus and the poroid fungi Dictyopanus and Favolaschia with Mycena, and of the reduced fungus Caripia with Gymnopus. Several clades are best supported by ecological, biochemical, or trophic habits rather than by morphological similarities.</em></small><br>[ID: 12099793]"

Steen BR, Lian T, Zuyderduyn S, MacDonald WK, Marra M, Jones SJ, Kronstad JW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen of worldwide importance that causes meningitis, leading to death in immunocompromised individuals. Unlike many basidiomycete fungi, C. neoformans is thermotolerant, and its ability to grow at 37 degrees C is considered to be a virulence factor. We used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to characterize the transcriptomes of C. neoformans strains that represent two varieties with different polysaccharide capsule serotypes. These include a serotype D strain of the C. neoformans variety neoformans and a serotype A strain of variety grubii. In this report, we describe the construction and characterization of SAGE libraries from each strain grown at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The SAGE data reveal transcriptome differences between the two strains, even at this early stage of analysis, and identify sets of genes with higher transcript levels at 25 degrees C or 37 degrees C. Notably, growth at the lower temperature increased transcript levels for histone genes, indicating a general influence of temperature on chromatin structure. At 37 degrees C, we noted elevated transcript levels for several genes encoding heat shock proteins and translation machinery. Some of these genes may play a role in temperature-regulated phenotypes in C. neoformans, such as the adaptation of the fungus to growth in the host and the dimorphic transition between budding and filamentous growth. Overall, this work provides the most comprehensive gene expression data available for C. neoformans; this information will be a critical resource both for gene discovery and genome annotation in this pathogen.</em></small><br>[ID: 12213776]"

Genomic and EST sequencing projects are underway for the serotype D strain JEC21 and the serotype A strain H99. As part of a genomics program for C. neoformans, we have constructed fingerprinted bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone physical maps for strains H99 and JEC21 to support the genomic sequencing efforts and to provide an initial comparison of the two genomes. The BAC clones represented an estimated 10-fold redundant coverage of the genomes of each serotype and allowed the assembly of 20 contigs each for H99 and JEC21. We found that the genomes of the two strains are sufficiently distinct to prevent coassembly of the two maps when combined fingerprint data are used to construct contigs. Hybridization experiments placed 82 markers on the JEC21 map and 102 markers on the H99 map, enabling contigs to be linked with specific chromosomes identified by electrophoretic karyotyping. These markers revealed both extensive similarity in gene order (conservation of synteny) between JEC21 and H99 as well as examples of chromosomal rearrangements including inversions and translocations. Sequencing reads were generated from the ends of the BAC clones to allow correlation of genomic shotgun sequence data with physical map contigs. The BAC maps therefore represent a valuable resource for the generation, assembly, and finishing of the genomic sequence of both JEC21 and H99. The physical maps also serve as a link between map-based and sequence-based data, providing a powerful resource for continued genomic studies</em></small><br>[ID: 12213782]"

Money NP<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Contrary to the rarity of totipotent cells in animals, almost every cell formed by a fungus can function as a \"stem cell\". The multicellular fruiting bodies of basidiomycete fungi consist of the same kind of filamentous hyphae that form the feeding phase, or mycelium, of the organism, and visible cellular differentiation is almost nonexistent. Mushroom primordia develop from masses of converging hyphae, and the stipe (or stem), cap, and gills are clearly demarcated within the embryonic fruiting body long before the organ expands and unfolds through water uptake and cell wall loosening. Though frequent references are made to gilled mushrooms in this article, the totipotent nature of fruiting body cells and lack of meristems is also applicable to basidiomycetes that spread their spore-producing tissues inside tubes (e.g., boletes), over spines and rippled surfaces, or form spores in cavities within the fruiting body. Even in the mature mushroom, every hypha retains its totipotency. Among animals, only sponges exhibit a similar degree of developmental flexibility, which is interesting, because these simple metazoans may be relatively close relatives of fungi.</em></small><br>[ID: 12325127]"

Cohen R, Persky L, Hazan-Eitan Z, Yarden O, Hadar Y<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus produces two types of extracellular peroxidases: manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP) and versatile peroxidase (VP). The effect of Mn2+ on fungal growth, peroxidase activity profiles, and lignin degradation by P. ostreatus was studied in liquid culture and under solid-state fermentation conditions on perlite, the latter resembling the natural growth conditions of this fungus. The fungus was grown in either a defined asparagine-containing basidiomycete selective medium (BSM) or in a rich peptone medium (PM). Biomass production, as determined by respiration experiments in solid-state fermentation and liquid cultures and fungal growth on Petri dishes, was higher in the PM than in the BSM. Mn2+ affected biomass production only in the PM on Petri dishes. In the nonamended PM, high levels of MnP and VP activity were detected relative to the nonamended BSM. Nevertheless, a higher rate of 14C-lignin mineralization was measured in the Mn2+-amended BSM, as determined during the course of 47 d of fermentation. Mn2+ amendment of the PM increased mineralization rate to that obtained in the Mn2+-amended BSM. The enzyme activity profiles of MnP and VP were studied in the BSM using anion-exchange chromatography. In the nonamended BSM, only minute levels of MnP and VP were detected. On Mn2+ amendment, two MnP isoenzymes (B1 and B2) appeared. Isoenzyme B2 was purified and showed 100% identity with the MnP isoenzyme purified in our previous study from PM-solid-state fermentation (P6). P6 was found to be the dominant isoenzyme in terms of activity level and gene expression compared with the VP isoenzymes. Based on these results, we concluded that Mn2+ plays a key role in lignin degradation under different nutritional and growth conditions, since it is required for the production of MnP in P. ostreatus.</em></small><br>[ID: 12396142]"

Banuett F, Herskowitz I<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ustilago maydis is a dimorphic Basidiomycete fungus with a yeast-like form and a hyphal form. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of bud formation and the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons of the yeast-like form during the cell cycle. We show that bud morphogenesis entails a series of shape changes, initially a tubular or conical structure, culminating in a cigar-shaped cell connected to the mother cell by a narrow neck. Labelling of cells with concanavalin A demonstrated that growth occurs at bud tip. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed that the actin cytoskeleton consists of patches and cables that polarize to the presumptive bud site and the bud tip and an actin ring that forms at the neck region. Because the bud tip corresponds to the site of active cell wall growth, we hypothesize that actin is involved in secretion of cell wall components. The microtubule cytoskeleton has recently been shown to consist of a cytoplasmic network during interphase that disassembles at mitosis when a spindle and astral microtubules are formed. We have carried out studies of U. maydis cells synchronized by the microtubule-depolymerizing drug thiabendazole which allow us to construct a temporal sequence of steps in spindle formation and spindle elongation during the cell cycle. These studies suggest that astral microtubules may be involved in early stages of spindle orientation and migration of the nucleus into the bud and that the spindle pole bodies may be involved in reestablishment of the cytoplasmic microtubule network.</em></small><br>[ID: 12409100]"

The inability of tahA to rescue the deltasod1 phenotype on copper-deficient medium indicated that tahA function is copper-dependent. Sequence analysis of the tahA promoter revealed several motifs that were similar to the conserved motifs found in the copper-regulated metallothionein and Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase genes, CUP1 and SOD1, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa and Candida glabrata. In contrast to its yeast homologue ATX1, tahA is induced under elevated copper concentrations in the medium (>0.25 micro M CuSO(4)) and repressed under copper starvation. The transcription of tahA was analysed in response to copper and iron, and after adding xenobiotica. The results are discussed in relevance to laccase expression.</em></small><br>[ID: 12480908]"

Bai X, Debaud JC, Schründer J, Meinhardt F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Bulk DNA isolated from the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Hebeloma circinans was treated with proteinase K and submitted to agarose gel electrophoresis. In addition to high molecular weight genomic DNA, three minor bands were detected. The band with the highest electrophoretic mobility (2.2 kbp) corresponds to double-stranded RNA. The two other bands, termed pHC1 and pHC2, were shown to be dsDNA molecules of 10.3 and 9.1 kbp, respectively. Treatment of the pHC elements with 3'- and 5'-specific exonucleases revealed a linear structure and proved that the 5' ends are protected from digestion; for pHC2, linearity was confirmed by restriction mapping. A 3.2 kbp HindIII fragment of pHC2 was cloned and sequenced; it contains two open reading frames encoding putative viral B type DNA and RNA polymerases. Thus, the fungus harbors a typical linear plasmid, up to now, rarely described for basidiomycetes and hitherto unknown for mycorrhizal species.</em></small><br>[ID: 12501314]"

Carbajo JM, Junca H, Terrón MC, González T, Yagüe S, Zapico E, González AE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Laccase, a phenoloxidase enzyme secreted by white-rot fungi, has a significant role in the degradation of lignin and environmental pollutants. Coriolopsis gallica is a ligninolytic basidiomycete that produces high levels of this extracellular enzyme. A laccase gene cglcc1 from this fungus has been cloned and sequenced. The capacity of C. gallica to efficiently degrade polyphenols has been successfully applied in our laboratory to the biotreatment and decolorization of several industrial wastewaters. This study focused on the effect of tannic acid, a natural compound widely distributed in plants, on the production of laccase activity by C. gallica. Our results showed an evident increase of extracellular laccase levels when C. gallica was grown in the presence of tannic acid. Concentrations of 50 and 100 microM of this compound increased laccase activity when compared with control samples grown without tannic acid. In addition, we found an increase in laccase transcript levels in C. gallica grown in culture media supplemented with tannic acid. The role of tannic acid was shown to be an inductor of laccase activity in this fungus, due to the enhancement of expression of the laccase gene at the transcriptional level.</em></small><br>[ID: 12619815]"

Joseph G, Kelsey RG, Thies WG<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Roots from healthy and diseased mature ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Laws., trees were excavated from a site near Burns, Oregon. The diseased trees were infected with black-stain root disease, Leptographium wageneri Kendrick, or annosus root disease, Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref., or both. Axial hydraulic conductivity of the roots was measured under a positive head pressure of 5 kPa, and the conducting area was stained with safranin dye to determine specific conductivity (k(s)). In diseased roots, only 8-12% of the cross-sectional xylem area conducted water. Resin-soaked xylem completely restricted water transport and accounted for 13-16% of the loss in conducting area. In roots with black-stain root disease, 17% of the loss in conducting area was associated with unstained xylem, possibly resulting from occlusions or embolisms. Based on the entire cross-sectional area of infected roots, the k(s) of roots infected with black-stain root disease was 4.6% of that for healthy roots, whereas the k(s) of roots infected with annosus root disease was 2.6% of that for healthy roots. Although these low values were partly the result of the presence of a large number of diseased roots (72%) with no conducting xylem, the k(s) of functional xylem of diseased roots was only 33% of that for healthy roots. The low k(s) values of functional xylem in diseased roots may be caused by fungus induced occlusions preceding cavitation and embolism of tracheids. The k(s) of disease-free roots from diseased trees was only 70% of that for healthy roots from healthy trees. The disease-free roots had the same mean tracheid diameter and tissue density as the healthy roots, suggesting that the lower k(s) in disease-free roots of diseased trees may also have been caused by partial xylary occlusions.</em></small><br>[ID: 12651373]"

Halada P, Leitner C, Sedmera P, Haltrich D, Volc J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We present the first report on characterization of the covalent flavinylation site in flavoprotein pyranose 2-oxidase. Pyranose 2-oxidase from the basidiomycete fungus Trametes multicolor, catalyzing C-2/C-3 oxidation of several monosaccharides, shows typical absorption maxima of flavoproteins at 456, 345, and 275 nm. No release of flavin was observed after protein denaturation, indicating covalent attachment of the cofactor. The flavopeptide fragment resulting from tryptic/chymotryptic digestion of the purified enzyme was isolated by anion-exchange and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The flavin type, attachment site, and mode of its linkage were determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the intact flavopeptide, without its prior enzymatic degradation to the central aminoacyl moiety. Mass spectrometry identified the attached flavin as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Post-source decay analysis revealed that the flavin is covalently bound to histidine residue in the peptide STHW, consistent with the results of N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation. The type of the aminoacyl flavin covalent link was determined by NMR spectroscopy, resulting in the structure 8alpha-(N(3)-histidyl)-FAD.</em></small><br>[ID: 12654310]"

Ohkuma M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Termites thrive in great abundance in terrestrial ecosystems and play important roles in biorecycling of lignocellulose. Together with their microbial symbionts, they efficiently decompose lignocellulose. In so-called lower termites, a dual decomposing system, consisting of the termite's own cellulases and those of its gut protists, was elucidated at the molecular level. Higher termites degrade cellulose apparently using only their own enzymes, because of the absence of symbiotic protists. Termite gut prokaryotes efficiently support lignocellulose degradation. However, culture-independent molecular studies have revealed that the majority of these gut symbionts have not yet been cultivated, and that the gut symbiotic community shows a highly structured spatial organization. In situ localization of individual populations and their functional interactions are important to understand the nature of symbioses in the gut. In contrast to cellulose, lignin degradation does not appear to be important in the gut of wood-feeding termites. Soil-feeding termites decompose humic substances in soil at least partly, but little is known about the decomposition. Fungus-growing termites are successful in the almost complete decomposition of lignocellulose in a sophisticated cooperation with basidiomycete fungi cultivated in their nest. A detailed understanding of efficient biorecycling systems, such as that for lignocellulose, and the symbioses that provide this efficiency will benefit applied microbiology and biotechnology.</em></small><br>[ID: 12658509]"

Xiao YZ, Tu XM, Wang J, Zhang M, Cheng Q, Zeng WY, Shi YY<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A recently isolated basidiomycete, Trametes sp. strain AH28-2, can be induced to produce a high level of laccases when grown on a cellobiose-asparagine liquid medium. After induction by kraft lignin, two major isozymes were detected in the fermentation supernatant of the fungus. The principal component laccase A, which accounts for about 85% of the total activity, can be purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by three chromatographic steps: DEAE-Sepharose FF, Superdex-200 and Mono-Q. The solution containing purified laccase is blue in color, and the ratio of absorbance at 280 nm to that at 600 nm is 22. The molecular mass of laccase A is estimated to be 62 kDa by SDS-PAGE, 57 kDa by FPLC, and measured as 58522 Da by MALDI mass spectrum. Laccase A is a monomeric glycoprotein with a carbohydrate content of 11-12% and an isoelectric point of 4.2. The optimum pH and temperature for oxidizing guaiacol are 4.5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The half-life of the enzyme at 75 degrees C is 27 min. The enzyme shows a good stability from pH 4.2 to pH 8.0. The K(m) values of the enzyme toward substrates 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), guaiacol and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol are 25, 420 and 25.5 microM, respectively, and the corresponding V(max) values are 670, 66.8, and 79 microM min(-1) x mg(-1), respectively. Laccase A activity is strongly inhibited by 0.1 mM NaN(3) or 0.1 mM cyanide. Two units of laccase A alone is able to completely oxidize 100 micromol 2,6-chlorophenol in 6 h. In the presence of 1 mM ABTS and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, 15.0 U laccase A is able to oxidize 45% and 70% of 50 micromol fluorene in 12 and 18 h, respectively. The laccase A gene was cloned by a PCR method, and preliminary analysis of its sequence indicates 87.0% similarity to the corresponding segment in the phenoloxidase gene from Coriolus hirsutus.</em></small><br>[ID: 12664149]"

Bücking H, Heyser W<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalytical investigations and microautoradiographic studies were carried out to examine whether the uptake and transfer of phosphate (P) by an ectomycorrhizal fungus is affected by the carbohydrate supply of its host plant. For this purpose, non-mycorrhizal seedlings of Pinus sylvestris L. and plants inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Suillus bovinus (L. ex Fr.) Kuntze were placed in the dark for 7 days in advance of a P supply. The subcellular element distribution and the uptake and distribution of (33)P was analyzed in non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal roots of these plants and compared with plants kept constantly under normal light conditions (control plants). The results show that placing non-mycorrhizal plants in the dark in advance of the nutrient supply led to (1) a reduction of the subcellular contents of P, S and K, but to an increase in the cytoplasmic Na content, and (2) an increase of (33)P absorption and translocation to the shoot. It can be assumed that this increased inflow of (33)P in non-mycorrhizal plants was due to P starvation after suppressed photosynthesis and reduced respiration of these plants. The suppression of photosynthesis by an ectomycorrhizal host plant and the resulting lower carbohydrate supply conditions for the ectomycorrhizal fungus led to (1) a decrease of P absorption by the mycobiont, (2) a change of the P allocation in the fungal cell compartments of an ectomycorrhizal root, and (3) a reduction of P transfer to the host plant. However, microautoradiographic studies revealed that, under these conditions, P was also absorbed by the mycorrhizal fungus and translocated via the Hartig net to the host plant. In mycorrhizal roots of plants placed in the dark in advance of the nutrient supply, the cytoplasmic P content of the Hartig net was reduced and, instead, a high number of polyphosphate granules could be detected within the hyphae. The results indicate that the exchange processes between the symbionts in a mycorrhiza are possibly linked and that P uptake and translocation by an ectomycorrhizal fungus is also regulated by the carbohydrate supply of its host plant.</em></small><br>[ID: 12682827]"

Yan Z, Xu J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Previous studies demonstrated that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was uniparentally transmitted in laboratory crosses of the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. To begin understanding the mechanisms, this study examined the potential role of the mating-type locus on mtDNA inheritance in C. neoformans. Using existing isogenic strains (JEC20 and JEC21) that differed only at the mating-type locus and a clinical strain (CDC46) that possessed a mitochondrial genotype different from JEC20 and JEC21, we constructed strains that differed only in mating type and mitochondrial genotype. These strains were then crossed to produce hyphae and sexual spores. Among the 206 single spores analyzed from six crosses, all but one inherited mtDNA from the MATa parents. Analyses of mating-type alleles and mtDNA genotypes of natural hybrids from clinical and natural samples were consistent with the hypothesis that mtDNA is inherited from the MATa parent in C. neoformans. To distinguish two potential mechanisms, we obtained a pair of isogenic strains with different mating-type alleles, mtDNA types, and auxotrophic markers. Diploid cells from mating between these two strains were selected and 29 independent colonies were genotyped. These cells did not go through the hyphal stage or the meiotic process. All 29 colonies contained mtDNA from the MATa parent. Because no filamentation, meiosis, or spore formation was involved in generating these diploid cells, our results suggest a selective elimination of mtDNA from the MATalpha parent soon after mating. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that mating type controls mtDNA inheritance in fungi.</em></small><br>[ID: 12702677]"

We report here the isolation of two cDNAs clones, CaCKB1 and CaCKB2, encoding C. albicans beta- and beta'-subunits, respectively. The predicted beta- and beta'-proteins have calculated molecular masses of 34 kDa and 31 kDa and show all major features conserved in beta-subunits of other organisms, including the N-terminal autophosphorylation site, the internal acidic region and a potential metal-binding motif. The deduced amino acid sequence of C. albicans beta-subunit displays 48% identity with that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has an unusually long C-terminal acidic region containing a putative autophosphorylation site. C. albicans beta' shows 54% sequence identity with its S. cerevisiae homologue. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses indicate that the mRNAs corresponding to both subunits are present in similar amounts in the yeast and hyphal forms of the fungus. To evaluate the biochemical properties of C. albicans beta- and beta'-subunits, both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Experiments performed in vitro indicate that both recombinant subunits reconstitute a fully functional holoenzyme when incubated with stoichiometric amounts of human recombinant alpha-subunit, as judged by their ability to abolish basal phosphorylation of calmodulin by human recombinant alpha-subunit and the reversion of the inhibitory effect by polylysine. In addition, both regulatory subunits can be phosphorylated by human recombinant alpha subunit. Phylogenetic analysis of beta- and beta'-proteins of C. albicans and other organisms shows that the CKB gene duplication occurred before the split of the ascomycete and basidiomycete lineages.</em></small><br>[ID: 12722181]"

Gola S, Kothe E<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The investigation of putative pheromone genes of basidiomycetes has been difficult since the small open reading frames are essentially annotated on the basis of a C-terminal farnesylation signal. In order to identify the functional reading frame, expression of small DNA fragments in the fungus is necessary. The expression system developed in the presented paper allows fusion to the promoter of the tef1 gene encoding the constitutively and highly expressed translation elongation factor EF1alpha. This system has been shown to be functional using an easily selectable gene, ura1. The application to identification of functional pheromone genes has been shown with the newly detected bap2(4) gene. The Bap2(4) pheromone is the first Balpha pheromone gene activating only a single receptor specificity.</em></small><br>[ID: 12746852]"

Haas H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>To acquire iron, all species have to overcome the problems of iron insolubility and toxicity. In response to low iron availability in the environment, most fungi excrete ferric iron-specific chelators--siderophores--to mobilize this metal. Siderophore-bound iron is subsequently utilized via the reductive iron assimilatory system or uptake of the siderophore-iron complex. Furthermore, most fungi possess intracellular siderophores as iron storage compounds. Molecular analysis of siderophore biosynthesis was initiated by pioneering studies on the basidiomycete Ustilago maydis, and has progressed recently by characterization of the relevant structural and regulatory genes in the ascomycetes Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. In addition, significant advances in the understanding of utilization of siderophore-bound iron have been made recently in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans as well as in the filamentous fungus A. nidulans. The present review summarizes molecular details of fungal siderophore biosynthesis and uptake, and the regulatory mechanisms involved in control of the corresponding genes.</em></small><br>[ID: 12759789]"

Mayr P, Petschacher B, Nidetzky B<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Xylose reductase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from cell extracts of the fungus Cryptococcus flavus grown on D-xylose as carbon source. The enzyme, the first of its kind from the phylum Basidiomycota, is a functional dimer composed of identical subunits of 35.3 kDa mass and requires NADP(H) for activity. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the reaction, D-xylose + NADPH + H(+)<--> xylitol + NADP(+), have been obtained at pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C. The catalytic efficiency for reduction of D-xylose is 150 times that for oxidation of xylitol. This and the 3-fold tighter binding of NADPH than NADP(+) indicate that the enzyme is primed for unidirectional metabolic function in microbial physiology. Kinetic analysis of enzymic reduction of aldehyde substrates differing in hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding capabilities with binary enzyme-NADPH complex has been used to characterize the substrate-binding pocket of xylose reductase. Total transition state stabilization energy derived from bonding with non-reacting sugar hydroxyls is approximately 15 kJ/mol, with a major contribution of 5-8 kJ/mol made by interactions with the C-2(R) hydroxy group. The aldehyde binding site is approximately 1.2 times more hydrophobic than n-octanol and can accommodate linear alkyl chains of <or=6 carbons. Hydrophobic interactions provide a total binding energy of approximately 10 kJ/mol. Specificity for the aldehyde substrate is achieved through large decreases in apparent K(m) ( approximately 100-fold) and smaller but significant increases in turnover number ( approximately 5-fold). We observed up to 250-fold preference of xylose reductase for reaction with pyridine carbaldehydes, 4-nitro-benzaldehyde, and alpha-oxo-aldehydes over reaction with D-xylose, perhaps reflecting a secondary role of this enzyme in detoxication metabolism of reactive endogenous aldehydes and compounds of xenobiotic origin.</em></small><br>[ID: 12761304]"

Larraya LM, Alfonso M, Pisabarro AG, Ramírez L<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Industrial production of the edible basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) is based on a solid fermentation process in which a limited number of selected strains are used. Optimization of industrial mushroom production depends on improving the culture process and breeding new strains with higher yields and productivities. Traditionally, fungal breeding has been carried out by an empirical trial and error process. In this study, we used a different approach by mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling culture production and quality within the framework of the genetic linkage map of P. ostreatus. Ten production traits and four quality traits were studied and mapped. The production QTLs identified explain nearly one-half of the production variation. More interestingly, a single QTL mapping to the highly polymorphic chromosome VII appears to be involved in control of all the productivity traits studied. Quality QTLs appear to be scattered across the genome and to have less effect on the variation of the corresponding traits. Moreover, some of the new hybrid strains constructed in the course of our experiments had production or quality values higher than those of the parents or other commercial strains. This approach opens the possibility of marker-assisted selection and breeding of new industrial strains of this fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 12788770]"

Manubens A, Avila M, Canessa P, Vicuña R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We previously identified and characterized three mnp genes coding for manganese peroxidase (MnP) in the white rot fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora. In this work, we assessed transcript levels of mnp genes in liquid cultures of this fungus grown under various conditions. In the absence of Mn(2+), mnp1 and mnp2 mRNA were detected by Northern hybridization, irrespective of the lack of extracellular MnP activity. Addition of Mn(2+) to the cultures led to a marked increase in both transcripts, the highest titers being observed at 10 micro M Mn(2+). mnp1 mRNA was not detected at Mn(2+ )concentrations above 80 micro M, whereas mnp2 mRNA was still observed at 320 micro M Mn(2+). Differential regulation of these genes was confirmed by the addition of Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Ag(+) and Cd(2+). These metal ions dramatically elevated both transcripts and also allowed the detection of the mnp3 transcript. In most cases, the increase in mRNA levels was partially abolished by the simultaneous presence of Mn(2+), although the latter was strictly required to detect extracellular MnP activity. However, the lignin-related compound syringic acid specifically increased the mnp1 transcript, although only in the absence of Mn(2+). These results indicate that there is no clear correlation between mnp mRNA levels and MnP activity. In addition, they strongly suggest that Mn(2+) plays a post-transcriptional role which is essential for the presence of active MnP in the extracellular fluid.</em></small><br>[ID: 12802504]"

Steffen KT, Hatakka A, Hofrichter M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The litter-decomposing basidiomycete Stropharia coronilla, which preferably colonizes grasslands, was found to be capable of metabolizing and mineralizing benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in liquid culture. Manganese(II) ions (Mn(2+)) supplied at a concentration of 200 micro M stimulated considerably both the conversion and the mineralization of BaP; the fungus metabolized and mineralized about four and twelve times, respectively, more of the BaP in the presence of supplemental Mn(2+) than in the basal medium. This stimulating effect could be attributed to the ligninolytic enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP), whose activity increased after the addition of Mn(2+). Crude and purified MnP from S. coronilla oxidized BaP efficiently in a cell-free reaction mixture (in vitro), a process which was enhanced by the surfactant Tween 80. Thus, 100 mg of BaP liter(-1) was converted in an in vitro reaction solution containing 1 U of MnP ml(-1) within 24 h. A clear indication was found that BaP-1,6-quinone was formed as a transient metabolite, which disappeared over the further course of the reaction. The treatment of a mixture of 16 different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) selected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as model standards for PAH analysis (total concentration, 320 mg liter(-1)) with MnP resulted in concentration decreases of 10 to 100% for the individual compounds, and again the stimulating effect of Tween 80 was observed. Probably due to their lower ionization potentials, poorly bioavailable, high-molecular-mass PAHs such as BaP, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, and indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene were converted to larger extents than low-molecular-mass ones (e.g., phenanthrene and fluoranthene).</em></small><br>[ID: 12839767]"

Probes and primers were based on a laccase gene for the pathogen and a polyubiquitin gene for the host.

The multiplex real-time PCR procedure had higher resolution and sensitivity during the early stages of colonization and also could be used to monitor the host. In the tissue culture experiment, host DNA was degraded more rapidly in the clone with low resistance than in the clone with high resistance. In the field experiment, the lesions elicited were not strictly proportional to the area colonized by the pathogen. Fungal colonization was more restricted and localized in the lesion in the clone with high resistance, whereas in the clone with low resistance, the fungus could be detected until the visible end of the lesion. Thus, the real-time PCR assay gives better resolution than does the traditionally used lesion length measurement when screening host clones for resistance.</em></small><br>[ID: 12902224]"

DBVPG 6662 has a defective sulfate transport system, whereas DBVPG 6739 barely grew on sulfate. They were compared for the ability to use dibenzothiophene (DBT) and related organic sulfur compounds as sulfur sources. In the presence of glucose as a carbon source and DBT as a sulfur source, strain DBVPG 6662 grew better than DBVPG 6739. In the presence of thiosulfate as a sulfur source, the two yeast strains did not use DBT, DBT-sulfone, benzenesulfonic acid, biphenyl, and fluorene. When the two strains were grown in the presence of glucose, strain DBVPG 6662 transformed 27% of the DBT present (10 micro M) at a rate of 0.023 micro mol liter(-1) h(-1) in 36 h. Traces of 2,2'-dihydroxylated biphenyl were transiently accumulated under these conditions. When the same strain was grown on glucose in the presence of a higher concentration of DBT (0.5 g liter(-1)), mainly in an insoluble form, the whole surface of the DBT crystals was colonized by a thick mycelium. This adherent structure was imaged by confocal microscopy with fluorescent concanavalin A, a lectin that specifically binds glucose and mannose residues. When DBVPG 6662 was grown on glucose in the presence of a commercial emulsion of bitumen, i.e., orimulsion, 68% of the benzo- and dibenzothiophenes and DBTs was removed after 15 days of incubation. The fungus adhered by hyphae to orimulsion droplets. When cultivated in the presence of commercial emulsifier-free fuel oil containing alkylated benzothiophenes and DBTs and having a composition similar to that of orimulsion, strain DBVPG 6662 removed only 11% of the total organic sulfur that occurs in the medium and did not adhere to the oil droplets. These results indicate that strain DBVPG 6662 is able to utilize the organic sulfur of DBT and a large variety of thiophenic compounds that occur extensively in commercial fuel oils by physically adhering to the organic sulfur source.</em></small><br>[ID: 12902259]"

Colao MCh, Garzillo AM, Buonocore V, Schiesser A, Ruzzi M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A cDNA coding for laccase was isolated from the white-rot fungus Trametes trogii 201. This cDNA corresponded to the lcc1 gene, which coded for a precursor protein of 517 amino acids with a 21 amino acid signal peptide. Comparison of the deduced sequence with known laccases showed that this enzyme was most closely related to Lac1 from basidiomycete PM1 and Trametes C30 (98% similarity). The expression of lcc1 was analysed under different growth conditions; transcription of this gene was enhanced by the addition of organic nitrogen to the medium. The level of lcc1 transcription was higher when T. trogii was grown on synthetic medium supplemented with yeast extract rather than mycological peptone or tryptone. The transcription data were in agreement with total laccase activity measured in the supernatant and suggested that laccase production and lcc1 transcription are coordinately regulated in this organism. The lcc1 cDNA was expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris and the detection of laccase activity indicated that this cDNA encodes a laccase.</em></small><br>[ID: 13680201]"

Muraguchi H, Ito Y, Kamada T, Yanagi SO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A genetic linkage map of the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus was constructed on the basis of the segregation of 219 RAPD markers, 28 RFLP markers and the A and B mating-type loci among 40 random basidiospore progeny from a single cross between a wild-type homokaryon, KF(3)#2, and an AmutBmut strain, #326. Thirteen linkage groups covering a total of 1346cM were identified and correlated to the 13 chromosomes of this fungus by hybridization of RFLP and RAPD marker probes to CHEF blots. These probes also revealed chromosome length polymorphisms (CLP), which could be associated with haplotype plots of the progeny. The average kb/cM ratio in this cross was approximately 27.9kb/cM. The AmutBmut strain undergoes sexual development without mating, because of mutations in both A and B mating-type loci, and has been used to identify mutations affecting developmental processes such as dikaryosis, fruit body morphogenesis, and meiosis. The markers in the map, especially the RAPD ones, would facilitate mapping of genes responsible for such mutations induced in the AmutBmut strain.</em></small><br>[ID: 14516762]"

Larrondo LF, Salas L, Melo F, Vicuña R, Cullen D<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Lignin degradation by the white rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium involves various extracellular oxidative enzymes, including lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and a peroxide-generating enzyme, glyoxal oxidase. Recent studies have suggested that laccases also may be produced by this fungus, but these conclusions have been controversial. We identified four sequences related to laccases and ferroxidases (Fet3) in a search of the publicly available P. chrysosporium database. One gene, designated mco1, has a typical eukaryotic secretion signal and is transcribed in defined media and in colonized wood. Structural analysis and multiple alignments identified residues common to laccase and Fet3 sequences. A recombinant MCO1 (rMCO1) protein expressed in Aspergillus nidulans had a molecular mass of 78 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the copper I-type center was confirmed by the UV-visible spectrum. rMCO1 oxidized various compounds, including 2,2'-azino(bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) and aromatic amines, although phenolic compounds were poor substrates. The best substrate was Fe2+, with a Km close to 2 micro M. Collectively, these results suggest that the P. chrysosporium genome does not encode a typical laccase but rather encodes a unique extracellular multicopper oxidase with strong ferroxidase activity.</em></small><br>[ID: 14532088]"

Kelly SL, Lamb DC, Jackson CJ, Warrilow AG, Kelly DE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of genes and proteins are well known for their involvement in pharmacology and toxicology, but also increasingly for their importance and diversity in microbes. The extent of diversity has only recently become apparent with the emergence of data from whole genome sequencing projects and the coming years will reveal even more information on the diversity in microbial eukaryotes. This review seeks to describe the historical development of these studies and to highlight the importance of the genes and proteins. CYPs are deeply involved in the development of strategies for deterrence and attraction as well as detoxification. As such, there is intense interest in pathways of secondary metabolism that include CYPs in oxidative tailoring of antibiotics, sometimes influencing potency as bioactive compounds. Further to this is interest in CYPs in metabolism of xenobiotics for use as carbon sources for microbial growth and as biotransformation agents or in bioremediation. CYPs are also current and potential drug targets; compounds inhibiting CYP are antifungal and anti-protozoan agents, and potentially similar compounds may be useful against some bacterial diseases such as tuberculosis. Of note is the diversity of CYP requirements within an organism, ranging from Escherichia coli that has no CYPs as in many bacteria, to Mycobacterium smegmatis that has 40 representing 1% of coding genes. The basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium surprised all when it was found to contain a hundred or more CYPs. The functional genomic investigation of these orphan CYPs is a major challenge for the future.</em></small><br>[ID: 14560664]"

Silk PJ, Macaulay JB<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Bjerkandera adusta produces many chlorometabolites including chlorinated anisyl metabolites (CAMs) and 1-arylpropane-1,2-diols (1, 2, 3, 4) as idiophasic metabolic products of L-phenylalanine. These diols are stereoselectively biosynthesized from a C7-unit (benzylic, from L-phenylalanine) and a C2-unit, of unknown origin, as predominantly erythro (1R,2S) enantiomers. Of the labeled amino acids tested as possible C2-units, at the 4-10 mM level, none were found to efficiently label the 2,3-propane carbons of the diols. However, glycine (2-13C), L-serine (2,3,3-d3) and L-methionine (methyl-d3) entered the biomethylation pathway. Neither pyruvate (2,3-13C2), acetate (1,2-13C2), acetaldehyde (d4) nor ethanol (ethyl-d5) labeled the 2,3-propane carbons of the diols at the 4-10 mM level. Pyruvate (2,3-13C2) and L-serine (2,3,3-d3) (which also entered the biomethylation pathway) did, however, effectively label the 2,3-propane carbons of the alpha-ketols and diols at the 40 mM level as evidenced by mass spectrometry. Glycerol (1,1,2,3,3-d5) also appeared to label one of the 2,3-propane carbons (ca. 5% as 2H2 in the C3 side chain) as suggested by mass spectrometric data and also entered the biomethylation pathway, likely via amino acid synthesis. Glycerol (through pyruvate), therefore, likely supplies C2 and C3 of the propane side chain with arylpropane diol biosynthesis. Incubation of B. adusta with synthetic [2-2H1, 2-18O]-glycerol showed that neither 2H nor 18O were incorporated in the alpha-ketols or diols. The oxygen atom on the C2 of the ketols/diols, therefore, does not appear to come from the oxygen atom on the C2 of glycerol. Glycerol, however, can readily form L-serine (which can then form pyruvate via PLP/serine dehydratase and involve transamination washing out the 18O label and providing the oxygen from water), and can then go on to label the C2-unit. Labeled alpha-ketol, phenyl acetyl carbinol (5) (PAC; ring-d(5), 2,3-13C2 propane) cultured with B. adusta leads to stereospecific reduction to the (1R,2S)-diol (6) (ring-d5 and 2,3-13C2); in all other metabolites produced, the 2,3-13C2) label is washed out. Incubation of the fungus with 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (13) produces a pooling of predominantly erythro (1R,2S) 1-(4'-fluorophenyl)-1,2-propane diol (18 as diacetate) (through the corresponding alpha-ketols 16, 17). Blocking the para-position with fluorine thus appears to prevent ring oxygenation and also chlorination, forcing the conclusion that para-ring oxygenation precedes meta-chlorination.</em></small><br>[ID: 14612230]"

Sp-AMP1 was identified in a substructured cDNA library of root tissue infected with the root rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum and encodes a mature peptide of 79 amino acid residues. Three additional members of the Sp-AMP family (Sp-AMPs 2-4) encode cysteine-rich proteins of 105 amino acids, each containing an N-terminal region with a probable cleavage signal sequence. Northern analysis confirmed that Sp-AMP expression is elevated in Scots pine roots upon infection with H. annosum. These peptides share 64% amino acid identity with a mature protein from Macadamia integrifolia (MiAMP1), which allowed us to build a homology model for preliminary analysis.

A multiplex reverse transcription-PCR method to simultaneously study the expression of these genes was developed in this study. The assay proved to be quick, simple, highly sensitive, and reproducible and is particularly valuable when numerous samples are to be analyzed and/or if the amount of initial mRNA is limited. It was used to analyze the effect of 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol (veratryl alcohol) and two of its isomers (2,5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol and 3,5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol) on differential laccase gene expression in Trametes sp. strain I-62. These aromatic compounds produced different induction patterns despite their chemical similarity. We found 2,5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol to be the best inducer of laccase activity while also producing the highest increase in gene expression; 3,5-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol was the next best inducer. Transcript amounts of each gene fluctuated dramatically in the presence of these three inducers, while the total amounts of laccase mRNAs seemed to be modulated by a coordinated regulation of the different genes.</em></small><br>[ID: 14660352]"

Kramer C, Kreisel G, Fahr K, Kässbohrer J, Schlosser D<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Iron-containing liquid cultures of the brown-rot basidiomycete Gloeophyllum striatum degraded 2-fluorophenol. Two simultaneously appearing degradation products, 3-fluorocatechol and catechol, were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Concomitantly, fluoride was produced at approximately 50% of the amount that theoretically could be achieved upon complete dehalogenation. Defluorination was strongly inhibited in the presence of either the hydroxyl radical scavenger mannitol or superoxide dismutase, as well as in the absence of iron. The addition of the natural iron chelator oxalate caused a clear but less extensive inhibition, whereas supplementation with the artificial iron chelator nitrilotriacetic acid increased fluoride production. Extracellular 2-fluorophenol degradation was evidenced by defluorination, observed upon addition of 2-fluorophenol to cell-free culture supernatants derived from iron-containing fungal cultures. Ultrafiltered culture supernatants oxidized methanol to formaldehyde, known as a product of the reaction of methanol with hydroxyl radical. In addition, G. striatum was found to produce metabolites extractable with ethyl acetate that are capable of reducing Fe3+. GC-MS analysis of such extracts revealed the presence of several compounds. The mass spectrum of a prominent peak matched those previously reported for 2,5-dimethoxyhydroquinone and 4,5-dimethoxycatechol, fungal metabolites implicated to drive hydroxyl radical production in Gloeophyllum.

By clustering all the EST obtained, a nonredundant set of 2,284 unique transcripts of either fungal or plant origin were identified. The expression pattern of these genes was analyzed using cDNA microarrays. The analyses showed that the plant and fungus responded to the symbiosis by altering the expression levels of a number of enzymes involved in carbon metabolism. Several plant transcripts with sequence similarities to genes encoding enzymes in the tricarboxylic cycle and electron transport chain were down regulated as compared with the levels in free-living roots. In the fungal partner, a number of genes encoding enzymes in the lipid and secondary metabolism were down regulated in mycorrhiza as compared with the saprophytically growing mycelium. A substantial number of the ESTs analyzed displayed significant sequence similarities to proteins involved in biotic stress responses, but only a few of them showed differential expression in the mycorrhizal tissue, including plant and fungal metallothioneins and a plant defensin homologue.

Additionally, the close similarity (83% deduced amino-acid identity) but the pronounced difference in the expression patterns of these two fungal lectins during fruiting-body formation affords a suitable object for study of the relation of structural difference to the observed functional disparity in the same organism. Both galectins were crystallized after recombinant production. Crystals belong to either the orthorhombic space group C222(1) (Cgl-1) or the monoclinic space group P2(1) (Cgl-2). The latter crystals diffracted to 1.6 A resolution using synchrotron radiation. To solve the phasing problem, a selenomethionine-containing variant of Cgl-1 was designed.

To clarify the relationship between membrane lipids and fruiting-body formation in this fungus, we investigated variations in levels of phospholipids, cerebrosides, fatty acyl residues in the major phospholipids, and fatty acyl and sphingoid base residues in cerebrosides during vegetative growth and fruiting-body formation. PC, PE, and PS were the primary phospholipids in the cells of L. edodes. After a shift in growth temperature of L. edodes mycelia has been shifted from 25 to 18 degrees C, the proportion of unsaturated FA (UFA), such as linoleic acid (18:2) and oleic acid (18:1), increased. In contrast, during fruiting-body formation induced by the temperature downshift to 18 degrees C, 18:2 of PC in the primordia and fruiting bodies decreased, and the UFA of PE and 18:1 of PC increased compared with the proportions in mycelia growing at 18 degrees C. These results showed that the proportions of fatty acyl residues in PC and PE differed during fruiting-body formation in L. edodes. Moreover, the amount of cerebrosides in primordia increased compared with those in mycelia and fruiting bodies and, in these differentiating tissues, the proportion of 2-hydroxypentadecanoic acid increased whereas that of 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid decreased compared with that in the mycelia. However, the proportion of sphingoid base residues in cerebrosides did not change during fruiting-body formation in L. edodes.</em></small><br>[ID: 15055237]"

Li G, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The root-rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum is a major pathogen of woody trees in temperate regions of the world. In this study, seedling root of Scots pine was used as an experimental model to investigate gene expression in conifer trees during challenge with H. annosum. Initial cellular and histochemical studies have established the systems and indicated the key sequence of events during the infection process. Also, to correlate histochemical observations with the time-dependent pattern of events in host gene expression, a transcriptome profiling of a selected set of host genes from a pine-root subtraction cDNA library was conducted. Differential screening of the subset of genes arrayed on nylon membrane with cDNA probes made from seedling roots infected for 1, 3, 7 and 15 days revealed a number of up-regulated genes [disease-resistance gene analog, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene homolog etc.] following inoculation. The results also showed strong expression of genes involved in cell defense and protein synthesis at the early stages of the infection (3-7 days) with a decline at late stages of infection (15 days). The decline in expression of key defense genes at late stages of infection correlated well with the period of vascular colonization and subsequent loss of root turgor. Northern analyses with two of the major induced genes (AMP homolog and disease-resistance gene analog) indicated a several-fold increase in host gene expression following infection. In addition, a particular single gene (thaumatin-like protein) was consistently expressed throughout the four sampling periods of the experiment. BlastX analyses revealed that the Scots-pine thaumatin-like gene shared 51-77% sequence homology with other thaumatin-like proteins in GenBank. The importance of these results in tree defense and use of conifer seedling root in host-parasite interaction in forest trees is discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 15108035]"

Asiegbu FO, Abu S, Stenlid J, Johansson M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The oxidizing enzyme laccase produced by many fungi is generally considered to be active in the biodegradation of lignin, a major plant cell wall component highly resistant to microbial attack. The enzyme is secreted at high levels by the P-type of the highly aggressive pathogen Heterobasidion annosum, but at much lower levels by the S-type which correlated with their varying wood decay capability. To investigate the evolutionary relationship between laccase genes of the different H. annosum types from several geographical regions we have compared the nucleotide sequence of the laccase gene from 32 different isolates of the fungus together with two other Asian isolates (H. araucariae, H. insulare). In addition to nucleotide sequence assessment, we have also cloned, characterized and analysed the partial sequences of the laccase gene from the homokaryotic (FSE-7: S-type; Sä16-4: P-type) and heterokaryotic (Faf-8: F-type) strains of H. annosum. Using degenerate primers, two distinct laccase gene fragments of 1.64 and 2 kb were amplified from the genomic DNA of this fungus. DNA sequence analyses showed that the 1.64 kb laccase fragment in all three H. annosum types shared significant homology (86-96%). But comparative analyses of the 1.64 and 2 kb laccase gene fragment revealed only 48% nucleotide sequence similarity. Using the cDNA sequence information, exon regions were predicted and this revealed that about nine small introns interrupted the genomic DNA. Southern hybridization analysis indicated a single copy of the gene in the homokaryotic S-type (FSE-7) examined but presence of double bands in the homokaryotic and heterokaryotic P-type strains of the fungus suggest the existence of two laccase genes. Northern analyses revealed that the gene is constitutively expressed but appear to be enhanced several fold with the addition of ferulic acid or oxalic acid. Alignments of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic analyses are presented allowing estimations of evolutionary relationships to be made. These comparisons indicate that laccase gene of P-type is distinct from other Heterobasidion sequences, including the outgroups H. araucariae and H. insulare, while the relationship between the S- and F-groups could not be resolved. Comparative phylogenetic analyses using predicted amino acid sequence also showed strong similarity to the laccases from other basidiomycetes (Pleurotus ostreatus, Phlebia radiata and Trametes versicolor) but least similar to laccases from ascomycete fungi. In addition, the results of McDonald-Kreitman test for possible evidence of selection based on analyses of two exon regions of the H. annosum laccase gene are presented and discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 15119350]"

Of these isolates, 47 were tissue isolates from fruit bodies and 59 were isolated from decayed wood. Nucleic acids were extracted from freeze-dried mycelia and dsRNA was separated by cellulose CF-11 chromatography and confirmed by digestions with specific nucleases. dsRNA was present in 19 and 14% of the tissue and wood isolates, respectively. From five of the fruit bodies containing dsRNA basidiospores were investigated and 10-84% of the germinated basidiospores contained dsRNA. On high nutrient media, the germination frequency of basidiospores was reduced by presence of dsRNA in the fruit body (P < 0.05); germination frequencies were 34 and 78% for spores from fruit bodies with and without dsRNA, respectively. The same trend was present also on low nutrient media, although not statistically significant; germination was 3 and 10% for spores from infected and dsRNA free fruit bodies, respectively. Transmission of dsRNA in H. annosum from mycelia into basidiospores together with the lowered germination frequency are likely to play a significant role in the life cycle of the fungus. The relative importance of different transmission routes for dsRNA in H. annosum is discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 15119351]"

Dong JL, Zhang YZ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Constant laccase activities were detected in culture supernatant of newly isolated basidiomycete Trametes gallica. Tryptone and glucose have great effects on the production of laccase. Two laccase isoenzymes (Lac I and Lac II) produced by T. gallica were purified to homogeneity (51- and 50-fold, respectively) by gel filtration chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, and improved native PAGE, with an overall yield of 24.8%. Lac I and Lac II from this fungus are glycoproteins with 3.6% and 4% carbohydrate content, the same molecular masses (by SDS-PAGE) of 60 kDa, and the pI of 3.1 and 3.0, respectively. Native gel electrophoresis indicates that the two laccases have different migration ratios. Lac I and Lac II have the same optimal pH of 3.0 on 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), pH 2.2 on 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and of pH 4.0 on guaiacol. The highest rate of ABTS oxidation for both laccases was reached at 70 degrees C. Both laccases are stable from pH 6 to 9, retaining 88-90% activity after 24 hr incubation, and show good stability when incubated at temperatures lower than 40 degrees C. The Km values of Lac I for ABTS, DMP, and guaiacol are 0.118 x 10(-2), 0.420, and 0.405 mM, respectively; the Km values of Lac II for ABTS, DMP, and guaiacol are 0.086 x 10(-2), 0.41, and 0.40 mM, respectively. Their N-terminal sequences are determined and show strong similarity with those from other basidiomycetes. Graphite-furnace atomic absorption analysis revealed that both laccases have four copper atoms per protein molecule, but they have no type I copper signal at around 600 nm and a type III copper signal near 330 nm. Cyanide, azide, and halides completely inhibit the enzyme activity, whereas EDTA has less inhibition.</em></small><br>[ID: 15195712]"

We examined the genetic structure of D. caperata populations from four Panamanian mangrove forests using AFLP markers. Using five primer pair combinations, 145 loci were detected, 98.6% of which were polymorphic. Each of the populations showed a high degree of genetic diversity (Nei's h ranging from 0.146 to 0.223). Results from minimum spanning trees and Mantel tests showed little evidence for small-scale spatial structure within sites. A significant amount of total genetic variation was partitioned among populations (phi(ST) = 0.21) separated by 10s to 100s of km, a considerably greater amount than has been detected in other mushroom and wood-decaying fungi sampled at equal or greater geographic distances. These results suggest that despite production of copious basidiospores capable of long distance dispersal, some homobasidiomycete fungi may be susceptible to genetic isolation due to habitat fragmentation.</em></small><br>[ID: 15209280]"

In a multiple-choice test using sawdust without fungus, termites showed a very strong preference for red oak sawdust over the other three species. In a paired choice test using fungus-inoculated sawdust, termites showed a preference for redwood over red oak sawdust. In a feeding test using autoclaved wood blocks without fungal decay, there was no difference in termite consumption of birch, red oak, or redwood. The relative preference of termites for redwood increased when blocks were decayed by M. troyanus for 3 and 8 wk.

Guaiacol (the best inducer of lcc gene transcription) and p-coumaric acid selectively induced expression of lcc1 and lcc2; ferulic acid induced lcc3 expression, while 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid had no marked effect on laccase gene transcription.

Clark TA, Anderson JB<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The impact of ploidy on adaptation is a central issue in evolutionary biology. While many eukaryotic organisms exist as diploids, with two sets of gametic genomes residing in the same nucleus, most basidiomycete fungi exist as dikaryons in which the two genomes exist in separate nuclei that are physically paired and that divide in a coordinated manner during hyphal extension. To determine if haploid monokaryotic and dikaryotic mycelia adapt to novel environments under natural selection, we serially transferred replicate populations of each ploidy state on minimal medium for 18 months (approximately 13,000 generations). Dikaryotic mycelia responded to selection with increases in growth rate, while haploid monokaryotic mycelia did not. To determine if the haploid components of the dikaryon adapt reciprocally to one another's presence over time, we recovered the intact haploid components of dikaryotic mycelia at different time points (without meiosis) and mated them with nuclei of different evolutionary histories. We found evidence for coadaptation between nuclei in one dikaryotic line, in which a dominant deleterious mutation in one nucleus was followed by a compensatory mutation in the other nucleus; the mutant nuclei that evolved together had the best overall fitness. In other lines, nuclei had equal or higher fitness when paired with nuclei of other histories, indicating a heterozygote advantage. To determine if genetic exchange occurs between the two nuclei of a dikaryon, we developed a 24-locus genotyping system based on single nucleotide polymorphisms to monitor somatic exchange. We observed genetic exchange and recombination between the nuclei of several different dikaryons, resulting in genotypic variation in these mitotic cell lineages.</em></small><br>[ID: 15342506]"

Ito Y, Muraguchi H, Seshime Y, Oita S, Yanagi SO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A gene that confers resistance to the systemic fungicide flutolanil was isolated from a mutant strain of the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus. The flutolanil resistance gene was mapped to a chromosome of approximately 3.2 Mb, and a chromosome-specific cosmid library was constructed. Two cosmid clones that were able to transform a wild-type, flutolanil-sensitive, strain of C. cinereus to resistance were isolated from the library. Analysis of a subclone containing the resistance gene revealed the presence of the sdhC gene, which encodes the cytochrome b560 subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex (Complex II) in the mitochondrial membrane. Comparison between the sdhC gene of a wild-type strain and that of a mutant strain revealed a single point mutation, which results in the replacement of Asn by Lys at position 80. Measurements of succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity in the transformants with mutant sdhC gene(s) suggest that flutolanil resistance of the fungus is caused by a decrease in the affinity of the SDH complex for flutolanil. This sdhC mutation also conferred cross-resistance against another systemic fungicide, carboxin, an anilide that is structurally related to flutolanil. In other organisms carboxin resistance mutations have been found in the genes sdhB and sdhD, but this is the first demonstration that a mutation in sdhC can also confer resistance. The mutant gene cloned in this work can be utilized as a dominant selectable marker in gene manipulation experiments in C. cinereus.</em></small><br>[ID: 15365819]"

We found that the fungal rDNA and ITS sequences from different species of ants were identical (or nearly identical) to each other, whereas 10 GenBank Leucoagaricus species showed higher ITS variation. Our findings suggest that Atta and Acromyrmex leafcutters living in geographic sites that are very distant from each other cultivate a single fungal species made up of closely related lineages of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus. We discuss the strikingly high similarity in the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the Atta and Acromyrmex symbiotic L. gongylophorus studied by us, in contrast to the lower similarity displayed by their non-symbiotic counterparts. We suggest that the similarity of our L. gongylophorus isolates is an indication of the recent association of the fungus with these ants, and propose that both the intense lateral transmission of fungal material within leafcutter nests and the selection of more adapted fungal strains are involved in the homogenization of the symbiotic fungal stock.</em></small><br>[ID: 15448866]"

The metabolism proceeded via hydroxylation of the aromatic ring and methylation of phenolic hydroxyl groups. Although the involvement of nitroreductase in the metabolism of 2,4-dinitrotoluene by many aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms including P. chrysosporium has been reported, no formation of 4-aminophenol was observed during 4-NP metabolism. The formation of 1,2-dimethoxy-4-nitrobenzene was effectively inhibited by exogenously added piperonyl butoxide, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, suggesting that cytochrome P450 is involved in the hydroxylation reaction. Thus, P. chrysosporium seems to utilize hydroxylation and methylation reactions to produce a more susceptible structure for an oxidative metabolic system.</em></small><br>[ID: 15448939]"

Five plasmids carrying different regulatory sequences to drive expression of the hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase) gene were tested. The promoter used was critically important in order to express heterologous genes in H. sublateritium. Constructions carrying the Agaricus bisporus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (P gpd) showed a good transformation efficiency, whereas constructions with the gpd promoter from ascomycetes were ineffective. Transformant clones showed a random integration pattern of plasmid DNA. Most transformants showed a single integrated copy of the transforming plasmid, but about 1.5% showed double or multiple integrations. All the analyzed transformants were mitotically stable and maintained the integrated exogenous DNA in the absence of antibiotic. The green fluorescent protein gene was expressed from the A. bisporus gpd promoter, as shown by RT-PCR studies, but no significant fluorescence was observed. Transformation of H. sublateritium opens the way for the genetic manipulation of clavaric acid biosynthesis in this fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 15480676]"

Using the fungal mitochondrial genetic code in which UGA codes for tryptophan, the positive strand of V18 dsRNA was found to contain a long open-reading frame with the potential to encode a protein of 700 amino acids (molecular mass 79,805 Da), including conserved motifs characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). This putative RDRP was shown to be related to putative RDRPs of several fungal mitochondrial viruses. It is proposed that V18 dsRNA is assigned to the genus Mitovirus in the family Narnaviridae and designated as H. mompa mitovirus 1-18 (HmMV1-18). Like other mitoviruses, HmMV1-18 RNA can be folded into potentially stable stem-loop structures at both the 5'- and 3'-termini, and both terminal sequences have inverted complementarity with the potential to form panhandle structure. BLAST analysis indicates that the RDRP encoded by HmMV1-18 is more closely related to those encoded by mitochondrial viruses of some ascomycetes than to that of the unassigned RsM2-1A1 dsRNA in the basidiomycetous Rhizoctonia solani.

In this study, the contents of soluble sugars, amino acids, alkaloids, ethylene, phenolics, tannins, flavonoids, pigments, malondialdehyde (MDA), glycerol, and fatty acids were analysed in cocoa (Theobroma cacao) shoots during the infection and development of WBD. Alterations were observed in the content of soluble sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), asparagine and alkaloids (caffeine and theobromine), ethylene, and tannins. Ethylene and tannins increased prior to symptom development and declined with the death of the infected tissues. Furthermore, MDA and glycerol concentrations were higher in infected tissue than in the controls, while fatty acid composition changed in the infected tissues. Chlorophylls a and b were lower throughout the development of the disease while carotenoids and xanthophylls dropped in the infected tissue by the time of symptom development. These results show co-ordinated biochemical alterations in the infected tissues, indicating major stress responses with the production of ethylene. Ethylene levels are hypothesized to play a key role in broom development. Some of the other biochemical alterations are directly associated with ethylene synthesis and may be important for the modification of its effect on the infected tissues.</em></small><br>[ID: 15642708]"

Kamitsuji H, Honda Y, Watanabe T, Kuwahara M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The regulation mechanism for expression of versatile peroxidase MnP2 by the basidiomycete fungus Pleurotus ostreatus was examined using chemically defined synthetic media. Expression of MnP2 was down-regulated at the transcription level by nutrient nitrogen, e.g., NH(4)(+), arginine or urea. As is often the case with other fungal manganese peroxidases, active MnP2 was not detected when Mn(2+) was omitted from the culture, while mnp2 transcription was barely affected by Mn(2+). However, Mn(2+) can be substituted by an MnP2 substrate, Poly R-478, since active MnP2 was detected extracellularly when the compound was added to the culture without Mn(2+). Enzyme stability assays with the purified MnP2 indicated an indispensable requirement for a substrate that can be used to complete the catalytic cycle, and avoid inactivation resulting from an excess H(2)O(2). This report is the first of the Mn(2+)-independent production of an active versatile peroxidase by P. ostreatus.</em></small><br>[ID: 15649426]"

A mature protein sequence has been verified by mass spectrometry mapping, the N-glycosylation sites have been identified and the glycosidic moieties characterized. Mature PoSl shows a cleaved peptide bond in the C-terminal region, which remains associated with the catalytic domain in a non-covalent complex. Reported results indicate that this enzyme is involved in the activation of other P. ostreatus secreted proteases, thus suggesting its leading role in cascade activation mechanisms. Analyses of the PoSl sequence by homology search resulted in the identification of a DNA sequence encoding a new protease, homologous to PoSl, in the Phanerochaete chrysosporium genome.

DePriest PT, Sikaroodi M, Lawrey JD, Diederich P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The anamorphic basidiomycete genus Marchandiomyces presently includes two common lichenicolous (lichen-inhabiting) species, M. corallinus and M. aurantiacus (teleomorph Marchandiobasidium aurantiacum). We describe here a new species, M. lignicola sp. nov., that is similar to M. corallinus in the colour of its sclerotia, but differs in having a wood-inhabiting (lignicolous) habit. The phylogenetic position of this lignicolous fungus was compared with the lichenicolous species of Marchandiomyces and related species currently placed in the basidiomycetous families Corticiaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of complete sequences of the nuclear small subunit and internal transcribed spacers ribosomal DNA, and a portion of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA. These DNA sequences were obtained from isolated cultures of freshly collected specimens. Significant Bayesian posterior probabilities, as well as maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses, indicate that the new lignicolous species is closely related to M. corallinus, the type species of Marchandiomyces. In most analyses these two species are monophyletic with the lichenicolous M. aurantiacus, although this relationship is not strongly supported. Since M. lignicola is more closely related to M. corallinus than to M. aurantiacus, either a transition to the lignicolous habit occurred recently within an ancestral lichenicolous group or, more likely, transition to the lichenicolous habit arose recently and in parallel from an ancestral lignicolous habit.</em></small><br>[ID: 15736863]"

Vainio EJ, Hallaksela AM, Lipponen K, Hantula J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The aim of this study was to test the usefulness of direct PCR-amplification in analysing fungal diversity in stumps. The analysis was conducted on stumps treated against Heterobasidion spp. using a commercial formulation of Phlebiopsis gigantea (Rotstop), and carried out using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments PCR-amplified directly from wood DNA samples using two separate fungus-specific primer pairs. On average, two (range 0-9) different amplification products were observed by DGGE in single wood samples of approximately 500 mm3. The PCR products were classified into operational taxonomical unit (OTU) groups based on their DGGE mobility. Six OTUs could be affiliated with a known species based on a reference fungal collection of 37 species: Heterobasidion annosum, H. parviporum. Hypholoma capnoides, P. gigantea, Resinicium bicolor and Stereum sanguinolentum. Sequence analyses did not give further identifications. OTU profiles from old (6 yr-old) and fresh (1-year-old) Scots pine and Norway spruce stumps from treated and untreated forest plots were compared statistically, and some significant differences were observed in the species composition between the treated and untreated plots. However, the frequency of most of the OTUs did not seem to be affected, and the treatment did not seem to have reduced the overall level of fungal diversity. Based on these results, direct PCR-amplification seems to be useful in analyses of fungal communities in decaying conifer stumps.</em></small><br>[ID: 15736868]"

Idnurm A, Heitman J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Light inhibits mating and haploid fruiting of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, but the mechanisms involved were unknown. Two genes controlling light responses were discovered through candidate gene and insertional mutagenesis approaches. Deletion of candidate genes encoding a predicted opsin or phytochrome had no effect on mating, while strains mutated in the white collar 1 homolog gene BWC1 mated equally well in the light or the dark. The predicted Bwc1 protein shares identity with Neurospora crassa WC-1, but lacks the zinc finger DNA binding domain. BWC1 regulates cell fusion and repression of hyphal development after fusion in response to blue light. In addition, bwc1 mutant strains are hypersensitive to ultraviolet light. To identify other components required for responses to light, a novel self-fertile haploid strain was created and subjected to Agrobacterium-mediated insertional mutagenesis. One UV-sensitive mutant that filaments equally well in the light and the dark was identified and found to have an insertion in the BWC2 gene, whose product is structurally similar to N. crassa WC-2. The C. neoformans Bwc1 and Bwc2 proteins interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Deletion of BWC1 or BWC2 reduces the virulence of C. neoformans in a murine model of infection; the Bwc1-Bwc2 system thus represents a novel protein complex that influences both development and virulence in a pathogenic fungus. These results demonstrate that a role for blue/UV light in controlling development is an ancient process that predates the divergence of the fungi into the ascomycete and basidiomycete phyla.</em></small><br>[ID: 15760278]"

Kapich AN, Steffen KT, Hofrichter M, Hatakka A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Culture liquids of the litter-decomposing basidiomycete Stropharia coronilla showed pro-oxidant activity promoting the peroxidation of linoleic acid. This activity depended on the presence of manganese peroxidase (MnP) in the fungal culture. Pro-oxidant activity maxima coincided with maximum MnP activities during the separation of extracellular proteins by anion-exchange chromatography. Purified MnP1 showed substantial pro-oxidant activity in the presence of acetate and Mn2+ ions, even without the addition of hydrogen peroxide. A non-phenolic beta-O-4 lignin model compound [LMC; 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-1,3-dihydroxypropane] was partially oxidized in an in vitro reaction system developing MnP-dependent lipid peroxidation. The chelating organic acids malonate and tartrate noticeably inhibited both the peroxidation of linoleic acid and the conversion of LMC in the system. The major product of the LMC oxidation was 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-oxo-2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-3-hydroxypropane; in addition, small amounts of 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (veratraldehyde) and 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic (veratric) acid were detected. Thus, MnP-initiated lipid peroxidation may be involved in the degradation of recalcitrant non-phenolic lignin substructures by litter-decomposing fungi similar to MnPs of wood-decaying fungi.</em></small><br>[ID: 15796893]"

Both compounds accumulate in P. blakesleeanus at higher levels than observed in other fungal species. D-Erythroascorbate glucoside reduced dichlorophenolindophenol as effectively as L-ascorbate, but was more stable to autoxidation. D-Erythroascorbate glucoside predominated in spores and stationary phase mycelium. Free D-erythroascorbate accumulated during the exponential phase of mycelial growth and decreased to very low levels in the stationary phase. This suggests an association between growth and free D-erythroascorbate. P. blakesleeanus converted exogenous D-arabinose to D-erythroascorbate and its glucoside.

This intein has been intensively studied and much information has been gained about its structure, mode of action and evolutionary history. We recently reported a second nuclear intein, Cne PRP8, encoded within the PRP8 gene of the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans. Subsequent studies have found allelic PRP8 inteins in several species of yeast and filamentous ascomycetes. Here we report two further, non-allelic, inteins from ascomycete species. The yeast Debaryomyces hansenii (which also has a VMA intein) has an intein encoded within the sequence of the glutamate synthase gene (GLT1). There are also inteins encoded in the homologous GLT1 genes of the yeast Candida (Pichia) guilliermondii and the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. These allelic GLT1 inteins occupy exactly the same site in the glutamate synthase and all contain domains that indicate the presence of a homing endonuclease (HEG). Podospora anserina, in addition, contains a second, non-allelic, intein encoded in the chitin synthase gene (CHS2); this intein also contains a HEG domain. We describe the phylogenetic relationships among the four eukaryote nuclear encoded inteins (VMA, PRP8, GLT1 and CHS2). We also consider this phylogeny in the broader context of eubacterial, archaeal and eukaryote viral and organelle inteins.</em></small><br>[ID: 15849795]"

On the other hand, these fungi remove all of the cellulose, both crystalline and amorphous, from wood when they degrade it. To resolve this discrepancy, we grew Gloeophyllum trabeum on microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and purified the major glycosylhydrolases it produced. The most abundant extracellular enzymes in these cultures were a 42-kDa endoglucanase (Cel5A), a 39-kDa xylanase (Xyn10A), and a 28-kDa endoglucanase (Cel12A). Cel5A had significant Avicelase activity--4.5 nmol glucose equivalents released/min/mg protein. It is a processive endoglucanase, because it hydrolyzed Avicel to cellobiose as the major product while introducing only a small proportion of reducing sugars into the remaining, insoluble substrate. Therefore, since G. trabeum is already known to produce a beta-glucosidase, it is now clear that this brown rot fungus produces enzymes capable of yielding assimilable glucose from crystalline cellulose.</em></small><br>[ID: 15870328]"

Rubini MR, Silva-Ribeiro RT, Pomella AW, Maki CS, Araújo WL, Dos Santos DR, Azevedo JL<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete fungus Crinipellis perniciosa (Stahel) Singer is the causal agent of Witches' Broom Disease of Cacao (Theobromacacao L.) which is the main factor limiting cacao production in the Americas. Pod losses of up to 90% are experienced in affected areas as evidenced by the 50% drop in production in Bahia province, Brazil following the arrival of the C. perniciosa in the area in 1989. The disease has proven particularly difficult to control and many farmers in affected areas have given up cacao cultivation. In order to evaluate the potential of endophytes as a biological control agent of this phytopathogen, the endophytic fungal community of resistant and susceptible cacao plants as well as affected branches was studied between 2001 and 2002. The fungal community was identified by morphological traits and rDNA sequencing as belonging to the genera Acremonium, Blastomyces, Botryosphaeria, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Cordyceps, Diaporthe, Fusarium, Geotrichum, Gibberella, Gliocladium, Lasiodiplodia, Monilochoetes, Nectria, Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Pleurotus, Pseudofusarium, Rhizopycnis, Syncephalastrum, Trichoderma, Verticillium and Xylaria. These fungi were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo by their ability to inhibit C. perniciosa. Among these, some were identified as potential antagonists, but only one fungus (Gliocladium catenulatum) reduced the incidence of Witches' Broom Disease in cacao seedlings to 70%.</em></small><br>[ID: 15951847]"

Nielsen K, Marra RE, Hagen F, Boekhout T, Mitchell TG, Cox GM, Heitman J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The study of quantitative traits provides a window on the interactions between multiple unlinked genetic loci. The interaction between hosts and pathogenic microbes, such as fungi, involves aspects of quantitative genetics for both partners in this dynamic equilibrium. One important pathogenic fungus is Cryptococcus neoformans, a basidiomycete yeast that can infect the human brain and whose mating system has two mating type alleles, a and alpha. The alpha mating-type allele has previously been linked to increased virulence potential. Here congenic C. neoformans strains were generated in the two well-characterized genetic backgrounds B3501alpha and NIH433a to examine the potential influence of genes outside of the mating-type locus on the virulence potential of mating type. The congenic nature of these new strain pairs was established by karyotyping, amplified fragment length polymorphism genotyping, and whole-genome molecular allele mapping (congenicity mapping). Virulence studies revealed that virulence was equivalent between the B3501 a and alpha congenic strains but the alpha strain was more virulent than its a counterpart in the NIH433 genetic background. These results demonstrate that genomic regions outside the mating type locus contribute to differences in virulence between a and alpha cells. The congenic strains described here provide a foundation upon which to elucidate at genetic and molecular levels how mating-type and other unlinked loci interact to enable microbial pathogenesis.</em></small><br>[ID: 15965241]"

Jia R, Tang BK, Zhang XB, He YM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Basidiomycete PM2, a lignin-degrading white rot fungus, produces lgnin peroxidase (Lip) and manganese peroxidase (Mnp) in nutrient nitrogen limited liquid cultures. This fungus was selected for its ability to decolorize azo group of dyes. In order to improve production of the peroxidases and rapid dye decolorizing activity by basidiomycete PM2, the addition of veratryl alcohol or Tween 80 to nutrient nitrogen limited liquid cultures were tested. It was found to have a large stimulatory effect on Mnp activities and decolorization rate of azo dyes. A maximum Mnp activities of 254.2 u/L with veratryl alcohol and 192.2 u/L with Tween 80 were achieved respectively. These values were about 3.4-fold and 2.5-fold higher than that obtained in the control cultures (without alcohol or Tween 80), whereas the levels of Lip activity detected were very low (about 12 u/L)in all the cultures. In further experiments using three kinds of azo dyes of congo red, orange G and orange IV, enzyme activities and dye decolorization were investigated in the above-mentioned cultures. The results showed that Mnp activities and decolorization were notably higher than those obtained in the control cultures in the presence of azo dyes. Cultures supplemented with Tween 80 were more adequate for dye decolorization. The rates of the decolorization with Tween 80 of congo red (95.4%), orange G (98.5%) and orange IV (54.4%) after 24 hours of dye incubation were higher than that supplemented with veratryl alcohol. According to the results, Mnp activities secreted by basidiomycete PM2 play an essential role in the process of dye decolorization. Tween 80 was the main factor affecting the decolorization. The analysis of structure of the three kinds of azo dyes indicats that the extent of decolorization is affected by the dye molecular structure. The types and quantity of the substituted groups on the aromatic ring of azo dyes have effect on the percentage of biological decolorization.</em></small><br>[ID: 15969128]"

Matsuzaki F, Wariishi H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We cloned full-length cDNA (PcCYP1f) encoding one of the cytochrome P450s in the lignin-degrading basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which showed high homology to P450s in the CYP53 family. PcCYP1f was expressed as an active microsomal protein using the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris expression system. Using the microsomal fraction containing PcCYP1f, a typical P450 CO-difference spectrum was obtained with absorption maximum at 448nm. Recombinant PcCYP1f catalyzed the hydroxylation of benzoic acid into 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in the presence of NADPH and P. chrysosporium cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. In contrast to other CYP53 P450s, this enzyme was shown to catalyze the hydroxylation of 3-hydroxybenzoate into 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate. Furthermore, 2- and 3-methylbenzoate were also shown to be substrates of PcCYP1f. This is the first report showing the expression of a functionally active Phanerochaete P450. Finally, real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that PcCYP1f is induced at a transcriptional level by exogenous addition of benzoic acid.</em></small><br>[ID: 16039998]"

       "<strong><a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000084991>DIRS-1 and the other tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons.</a></strong><br>2005. Poulter RT, Goodwin TJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>DIRS-1 is a retroelement from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Until recently only two related retrotransposons had been described: PAT from the nematode Panagrellus redivivus and Prt1 from the zygomycete fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus. Analyses of the reverse transcriptase sequences encoded by these three elements suggested that they were closely related to each other and more distantly related to the Ty3/gypsy Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retroelements. They have several unusual structural features that distinguish them from typical LTR elements. For instance, they each encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR), but not a DDE-type integrase or an aspartic protease. Although the DIRS-1-related elements are bordered by terminal repeats these differ from typical LTRs in a number of ways. In DIRS-1, for example, the terminal repeats are inverted (complementary), non-identical in sequence, and the outer edges of the terminal sequences are repeated (adjacent to each other) in the internal region. PAT has so-called \"split\" direct repeats in which the unrelated terminal sequences appear as direct repeats adjacent to each other in the internal region. The only repetition displayed by Prt1 is the presence of short inverted terminal repeats, but the sequenced copy of this element is believed to be a truncated version of an element with a structure resembling DIRS-1. The unusual structure of the terminal repeats of the DIRS1-like elements appears to be related to their replication via free circular intermediates. Site-specific recombination is believed to integrate the circle without creating duplications of the target sites. In recognition of these important distinctions it is proposed that the retrotransposons that encode tyrosine recombinases be called the tyrosine recombinase (or YR) retrotransposons. Recently a large number of additional YR retrotransposons have been described, including elements from fungi (zygomycetes and basidiomycetes), plants (green algae) and a wide range of animals including nematodes, insects, sea urchins, fish and amphibia, while remnants of elements related to DIRS-1 occur in the human genome. The complete set of YR retrotransposons can be divided into two major groups, the DIRS elements and the Ngaro elements, the two groups forming distinct clades on phylogenetic trees based on alignments of RT/RH and recombinase sequences, and also having some structural distinctions. A third group of transposable elements, which we call Cryptons, also carry tyrosine recombinases. These elements do not encode a reverse transcriptase and so are believed to be DNA transposons not retrotransposons. They have been detected in several pathogenic fungi, including the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, and the ascomycetes Coccidioides posadasii and Histoplasma capsulatum. Sequence comparisons suggest that the Crypton YRs are related to those of the YR retrotransposons. We suggest that the YR retrotransposons arose from the combination of a Crypton-like YR DNA transposon and the RT/RH encoding sequence of a retrotransposon.</em></small><br>[ID: 16093711]"

Poulsen M, Cafaro M, Boomsma JJ, Currie CR<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants maintain two highly specialized, vertically transmitted mutualistic ectosymbionts: basidiomycete fungi that are cultivated for food in underground gardens and actinomycete Pseudonocardia bacteria that are reared on the cuticle to produce antibiotics that suppress the growth of Escovopsis parasites of the fungus garden. Mutualism stability has been hypothesized to benefit from genetic uniformity of symbionts, as multiple coexisting strains are expected to compete and, thus, reduce the benefit of the symbiosis. However, the Pseudonocardia symbionts are likely to be involved in Red-Queen-like antagonistic co-evolution with Escovopsis so that multiple strains per host might be favoured by selection provided the cost of competition between bacterial strains is low. We examined the genetic uniformity of the Pseudonocardia symbionts of two sympatric species of Acromyrmex ants by comparing partial sequences of the nuclear Elongation Factor-Tu gene. We find no genetic variation in Pseudonocardia symbionts among nest mate workers, neither in Acromyrmex octospinosus, where colonies are founded by a single queen, nor in Acromyrmex echinatior, where mixing of bacterial lineages might happen when unrelated queens cofound a colony. We further show that the two ant species maintain the same pool of Pseudonocardia symbionts, indicating that horizontal transmission occasionally occurs, and that this pool consists of two distinct clades of closely related Pseudonocardia strains. Our finding that individual colonies cultivate a single actinomycete strain is in agreement with predictions from evolutionary theory on host-symbiont conflict over symbiont mixing, but indicates that there may be constraints on the effectiveness of the bacterial symbionts on an evolutionary timescale.</em></small><br>[ID: 16156826]"

As these differences were linked to the different cell division and growth mechanism of these species, we sought to analyse the roles of Cdc25 in Ustilago maydis, which as S. cerevisiae divides by budding, but relies in a polar growth. This basidiomycete yeast is perfectly suited to analyse the relationships between cell cycle and morphogenesis. We show that U. maydis contains a single Cdc25-related protein, which is essential for growth. Loss of Cdc25 function results in a specific G2 arrest that correlated with high level of Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdk1. Moreover, we show genetic interactions of cdc25 with wee1 and clb2 that support the notion that in U. maydis Cdc25 counteracts the Wee1-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1-Clb2 complex. Our results supports a model in which inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 is a primary mechanism operating at G2/M transition in this fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 16313631]"

Here, we investigated phenol-oxidizing enzymes in symbiotic fungi and fungus combs (a substrate used to cultivate symbiotic fungi) from termites belonging to the genera Macrotermes, Odontotermes, and Microtermes in Thailand, because these enzymes are potentially involved in the degradation of phenolic compounds during fungus comb aging. Laccase activity was detected in all the fungus combs examined as well as in the culture supernatants of isolated symbiotic fungi. Conversely, no peroxidase activity was detected in any of the fungus combs or the symbiotic fungal cultures. The laccase cDNA fragments were amplified directly from RNA extracted from fungus combs of five termite species and a fungal isolate using degenerate primers targeting conserved copper binding domains of basidiomycete laccases, resulting in a total of 13 putative laccase cDNA sequences being identified. The full-length sequences of the laccase cDNA and the corresponding gene, lcc1-2, were identified from the fungus comb of Macrotermes gilvus and a Termitomyces strain isolated from the same fungus comb, respectively. Partial purification of laccase from the fungus comb showed that the lcc1-2 gene product was a dominant laccase in the fungus comb. These findings indicate that the symbiotic fungus secretes laccase to the fungus comb. In addition to laccase, we report novel genes that showed a significant similarity with fungal laccases, but the gene product lacked laccase activity. Interestingly, these genes were highly expressed in symbiotic fungi of all the termite hosts examined.</em></small><br>[ID: 16332742]"

Hildén KS, Mäkelä MR, Hakala TK, Hatakka A, Lundell T<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Lignin peroxidase (LiP) is the first enzyme connected to oxidative breakdown of the aromatic plant heteropolymer lignin and related xenobiotics. However, this extracellular enzyme has been described in only a few species of wood-decaying basidiomycetous fungi. The white rot basidiomycete Phlebia radiata 79 readily produces a versatile set of lignin-oxidizing enzymes including lignin and manganese peroxidases (LiPs and MnPs) and laccases. Here we describe genomic and primary structure of two new LiP-encoding genes, Pr-lip1 and Pr-lip4, and genomic characterization for isozyme LiP3/LIII of P. radiata, encoded by the gene depicted Pr-lip3. Pr-lip1 and Pr-lip4 code for 370- and 361-amino-acid long proteins beginning with 26- and 24-amino-acid secretion pre-propeptides, respectively. Translated LiP1 and LiP4 share the highest protein sequence identity (74 and 86%) with P. radiata LiP3, and 70% identity with the one deduced LiP from Bjerkandera adusta. The three P. radiata LiP sequences form a coherent phylogenetic cluster, which is further supported by similarities within gene organization interrupted by 11-introns. To find out the significance of LiP upon fungal growth on natural lignocellulose, such as wood, we studied ligninolytic gene expression on hardwood (milled alder) and softwood (spruce chips). All the LiP-encoding genes were expressed on wood with predominance of Pr-lip3 transcript abundance, in particular on spruce wood chips, where also time-dependent expression of the multiple lip genes was observed.</em></small><br>[ID: 16333658]"

Roy BP, Archibald F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The white rot basidiomycete Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor can substantially increase the brightness and decrease the lignin content of washed, unbleached hardwood kraft pulp (HWKP). Monokaryotic strain 52J was used to study how HWKP and the lignin in HWKP affect the carbon metabolism and secretions of T. versicolor. Earlier work indicated that a biobleaching culture supernatant contained all components necessary for HWKP biobleaching and delignification, but the supernatant needed frequent contact with the fungus to maintain these activities. Thus, labile small fungal metabolites may be the vital biobleaching system components renewed or replaced by the fungus. Nearly all of the CO(2) evolved by HWKP-containing cultures came from the added glucose, indicating that HWKP is not an important source of carbon or energy during biobleaching. Carbon dioxide appeared somewhat earlier in the absence of HWKP, but the culture partial O(2) pressure was little affected by the presence of pulp. The presence of HWKP in a culture markedly increased the culture's production of a number of acidic metabolites, including 2-phenyllactate, oxalate, adipate, glyoxylate, fumarate, mandelate, and glycolate. Although the total concentration of these pulp-induced metabolites was only 4.3 mM, these compounds functioned as effective manganese-complexing agents for the manganese peroxidase-mediated oxidation of phenol red, propelling the reaction at 2.4 times the rate of 50 mM sodium malonate, the standard chelator-buffer. The presence of HWKP in a culture also markedly stimulated fungal secretion of the enzymes manganese peroxidase, cellulase, and cellobiose-quinone oxidoreductase, but not laccase (phenol oxidase) or lignin peroxidase.</em></small><br>[ID: 16348963]"

The pulse-labeling data, obtained with C-labeled phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, benzoic acid, and benzaldehyde, showed that radiocarbon labeling followed a reproducible sequence: it peaked first in cinnamate, then in benzoate and benzaldehyde, and finally in VA. Phenylalanine, cinnamate, benzoate, and benzaldehyde were all efficient precursors of VA in vivo. The isotope-trapping experiments showed that exogenous, unlabeled benzoate and benzaldehyde were effective traps of phenylalanine-derived C.

Urzúa U, Kersten PJ, Vicuña R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The ligninolytic system of the basidiomycete Ceriporiopsis subvermispora is composed of manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase. In this work, the source of extracellular hydrogen peroxide required for MnP activity was investigated. Our attention was focused on the possibility that hydrogen peroxide might be generated by MnP itself through the oxidation of organic acids secreted by the fungus. Both oxalate and glyoxylate were found in the extracellular fluid of C. subvermispora cultures grown in chemically defined media, where MnP is also secreted. The in vivo oxidation of oxalate was measured; CO(2) evolution was monitored after addition of exogenous [C]oxalate to cultures at constant specific activity. In standard cultures, evolution of CO(2) from oxalate was maximal at day 6, although the MnP titers were highest at day 12, the oxalate concentration was maximal (2.5 mM) at day 10, and the glyoxylate concentration was maximal (0.24 mM) at day 5. However, in cultures containing low nitrogen levels, in which the pH is more stable, a better correlation between MnP titers and mineralization of oxalate was observed. Both MnP activity and oxidation of [C]oxalate were negligible in cultures lacking Mn(II). In vitro assays confirmed that Mn(II)-dependent oxidation of [C]oxalate by MnP occurs and that this reaction is stimulated by glyoxylate at the concentrations found in cultures. In addition, both organic acids supported phenol red oxidation by MnP without added hydrogen peroxide, and glyoxylate was more reactive than oxalate in this reaction. Based on these results, a model is proposed for the extracellular production of hydrogen peroxide by C. subvermispora.</em></small><br>[ID: 16349495]"

Quantitative PCR analysis of genomic DNA obtained from samples taken at different times along the lesion length in living bark indicated that the fungus was present in higher amounts and extended further into the host tissue in the susceptible clone than in the resistant clone. In protein extracts from the same lesion samples, there were differences in temporal and spatial changes in host chitinase isoform profiles between the resistant and susceptible clones. Host chitinase isoforms with pI values approximately 4.8, 4.4 and 3.7 increased more during the first 7 days after wounding and inoculation and extended further along the lesion length in the resistant clone than in the susceptible clone. These results suggest that the time from wounding and infection to induction of defense-related expression is shorter in the resistant clone indicating a more efficient host defense response than in the susceptible clone. Tissue cultures from the same clones were not resistant to H. annosum and showed no difference in the timing of the increase in chitinase isoforms in response to the pathogen. However, tissue cultures from both clones showed an increase in chitinase isoforms within 6 to 24 h past inoculation, indicating that increased chitinase expression in response to the pathogen is part of a general defense response common to both mature clones and tissue cultures.</em></small><br>[ID: 16356913]"

Theoretically either of these characteristics, a wide geographic range or generalized host ecology, could provide opportunities for genetic differentiation within this species.

Vegetative mycelial compatibility tests were used to determine compatibility groupings from among the isolates; in addition, several PCR amplification products (RAPD, nuITS rDNA) were obtained for each isolate. A number of distinct compatibility groups were recognizable based on geography, not host ecology. In addition compatible isolates always were restricted to either North America or Europe. However RAPD markers indicated that compatible isolates are not always genetically identical. The presence of sequence heterozygosity at specific positions indicated that the isolates are heterokaryotic and a number of distinct haplotypes could be identified based on ITS variation at three separate locations.

Dons JJ, Mulder GH, Rouwendal GJ, Springer J, Bremer W, Wessels JG<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The sequence of a gene and its mRNA, which is abundantly expressed during fruiting body initiation in the Basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune, is described. This gene (1G2), the first to be analyzed in this group of fungi, contains an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 94 amino acids and a mol. wt. of 9842. A possible signal peptide of 20 residues and one glycosylation site were found. The sequence analysis was hampered by a sequence rearrangement in one of the cDNA clones, probably due to base pairing between short complementary sequences present at the 5' and 3' ends of the mRNA. The 5' untranslated leader sequence is 57 bp long and harbors a possible ribosome binding site close to the AUG start codon. A TATA box is found at position -31 upstream of transcription initiation. The 3' untranslated sequence is 200 bp long and contains the sequence -TATATAAT-, which most likely represents the polyadenylation signal. Some heterogeneity as to the site of addition of the poly(A) tail was observed. The coding region of the gene is interrupted by three very small introns of 53, 49 and 49 bp, respectively. The 5' and 3' splice junctions are conserved: GTGAGT- and -AG-, respectively. Each intron contains a sequence complementary to the 5' end of the intron. These sequences are compared with internal conserved sequences in yeast and filamentous fungi with regard to their possible role in splicing.</em></small><br>[ID: 16453552]"

Pringle A, Patek SN, Fischer M, Stolze J, Money NP<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ballistospore discharge is a feature of 30000 species of mushrooms, basidiomycete yeasts and pathogenic rusts and smuts. The biomechanics of discharge may involve an abrupt change in the center of mass associated with the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. However this process occurs so rapidly that the launch of the ballistospore has never been visualized. Here we report ultra high-speed video recordings of the earliest events of spore dispersal using the yeast Itersonilia perplexans and the distantly related jelly fungus Auricularia auricula. Images taken at camera speeds of up to 100,000 frames/ s demonstrate that ballistospore discharge does involve the coalescence of Buller's drop and the spore. Recordings of I. perplexans demonstrate that although coalescence may result from the directed collapse of Buller's drop onto the spore, it also may involve the movement of the spore toward the drop. The release of surface tension at coalescence provides the energy and directional momentum to propel the drop and spore away from the fungus. Analyses show that ballistospores launch into the air at initial accelerations in excess of 10,000 g. There is no known analog of this micromechanical process in animals, plants or bacteria, but the recent development of a surface tension motor may mimic the fungal biology described here.</em></small><br>[ID: 16457355]"

Wengel M, Kothe E, Schmidt CM, Heide K, Gleixner G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We investigated the degradation of refractory organic matter (OM) by the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune to understand the release of dissolved organic compounds, heavy metals and sulfur. The investigated OM consisted of: charcoal, the short time end product of high temperature wood alteration in the absence of oxygen and composed mainly of pure OM; and black shales composed of clay minerals, quartz, sulfides and OM formed geogenically in an abiotic long-term process. In both cases, the OM fraction contains mainly polyaromatic hydrocarbons. We investigated the degradation of these fractions by a wood-rotting basidiomycete, which is able to produce exoenzymes like peroxidases and laccases. These enzymes can perform radical reactions to oxidize OM (like lignin) and therefore hypothetically are able to degrade OM from charcoal and/or low grade metamorphic black shales. Release of new components into dissolved organic carbon (DOC) could be detected in both cases. The attack on OM in the case of black shales coincided with the release of the heavy metals Fe, Mn and Ni. By following sulfur concentrations throughout the experiment, it was shown that heavy metal release is not due to pyrite oxidation. Ground black shale and charcoal samples were inoculated with S. commune in a diluted minimal medium containing aspartic acid and glucose. The aqueous and solid phases were sampled after 1, 7, 28 and 84 days. DOC was measured as non purgeable carbon and characterized by size exclusion chromatography and UV detection. Carbon concentrations of the solid phase were determined by element analyses. After initial decrease of the DOC concentrations due to the degradation of the carbon source provided with the medium, DOC increased up to 80 mg/l after 84 days. Carbon decreased in the solid fraction confirming that this carbon was released as DOC by the fungus. The newly generated DOC formed larger agglomerations than the DOC of the growth medium. The investigation proved that the degradation of persistent carbon sources, such as charcoal and black shale, is accelerated by fungal activity. Consequently, the associated release of heavy metals is also accelerated by the fungus. Main products of the biological degradation processes were organic heavy metal complexes which can enter the environment.</em></small><br>[ID: 16483638]"

Mühlmann O, Göbl F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete species Lactarius deterrimus Gröger is considered to be a strictly host-specific mycobiont of Picea abies (L.) Karst. However, we identified arbutoid mycorrhiza formed by this fungus on the roots of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng. in a mixed stand at the alpine timberline; typical ectomycorrhiza of P. abies were found in close relation. A. uva-ursi is known as an extremely unspecific phytobiont. The mycorrhizae of both associations are described and compared morphologically. The mycorrhiza formed by L. deterrimus on both A. uva-ursi and P. abies show typical ectomycorrhizal features such as a hyphal mantle and a Hartig net. The main difference between the mycorrhizal symbioses with the different phytobionts is the occurrence of intracellular hyphae in the epidermal cells of A. uva-ursi. This emphasizes the importance of the plant partner for mycorrhizal anatomy. This is the first report of a previously considered host-specific ectomycorrhizal fungus in association with A. uva-ursi under natural conditions. The advantages of this loose specificity between the fungus and plant species is discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 16496189]"

Filho DF, Pungartnik C, Cascardo JC, Brendel M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Breaking of hyphae derived from growth of the phytopathogenic fungus Crinipellis perniciosa in liquid media yielded cell aggregates that performed as \"quasi single cell\" in toxicity assays. When treated with the chemical mutagens 4-nitroquinoleine-1-oxide (4NQO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or paraquat (PAQ) as well as with ultraviolet light (UVC), broken hyphae of C. perniciosa gave a single cell-like response, i.e., survival curves similar to those obtained when treating single-cell suspensions. C. perniciosa had significantly higher UVC resistance than haploid bakers yeast but was more sensitive to 4NQO and extremely sensitive to PAQ and H2O2 when compared to likewise-treated yeast. Haploid C. perniciosa basidiospores (monokaryotic) were significantly more UVC resistant than C. perniciosa broken hyphae and than haploid and diploid yeast wild-type strains. This suggests a high capacity in C. perniciosa for repair of UVC-induced DNA lesions or, alternatively, an efficient protection from UVC irradiation, especially in basidiospores. The pronounced sensitivity of the dikaryotic form of C. perniciosa to PAQ and H2O2 points to a weak protection from oxidative stress-inducing agents.</em></small><br>[ID: 16586019]"

Wallander H, Lindahl BD, Nilsson LO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Transfer of (15)N between interacting mycelia of a wood-decomposing fungus (Hypholoma fasciculare) and an ectomycorrhizal fungus (Tomentellopsis submollis) was studied in a mature beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest. The amount of (15)N transferred from the wood decomposer to the ectomycorrhizal fungus was compared to the amount of (15)N released from the wood-decomposing mycelia into the soil solution as (15)N-NH(4). The study was performed in peat-filled plastic containers placed in forest soil in the field. The wood-decomposing mycelium was growing from an inoculated wood piece and the ectomycorrhizal mycelium from an introduced root from a mature tree. The containers were harvested after 41 weeks when physical contact between the two foraging mycelia was established. At harvest, (15)N content was analyzed in the peat (total N and (15)NH(4) (+)) and in the mycorrhizal roots. A limited amount of (15)N was transferred to the ectomycorrhizal fungus and this transfer could be explained by (15)NH(4) (+) released from the wood-decomposing fungus without involving any antagonistic interactions between the two mycelia. Using our approach, it was possible to study nutritional interactions between basidiomycete mycelia under field conditions and this and earlier studies suggest that the outcomes of such interactions are highly species-specific and depend on environmental conditions such as resource availability.</em></small><br>[ID: 16598505]"

Walton FJ, Heitman J, Idnurm A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In eukaryotes the complex processes of development, differentiation, and proliferation require carefully orchestrated changes in cellular morphology. Single-celled eukaryotes provide tractable models for the elucidation of signaling pathways involved in morphogenesis. Here we describe a pathway regulating cell polarization and separation in the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. An insertional mutagenesis screen identified roles for the ARF1, CAP60, NDH1, KIC1, CBK1, SOG2, and TAO3 genes in establishing normal colony morphology. ARF1 and CAP60 are also required for capsule production, a virulence factor, and ARF1 confers resistance to the antifungal fluconazole. KIC1, CBK1, SOG2, and TAO3 are homologues of genes conserved in other eukaryotes; in Saccharomyces cerevisiae they constitute components of the RAM (regulation of Ace2p activity and cellular morphogenesis) signaling pathway. A targeted deletion of a fifth component of RAM (MOB2) conferred identical phenotypes to kic1, cbk1, sog2, or tao3 mutations. Characterization of these genes in C. neoformans revealed unique features of the RAM pathway in this organism. Loss of any of these genes caused constitutive hyperpolarization instead of the loss of polarity seen in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, sensitivity to the drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A demonstrates that the RAM pathway acts in parallel with the protein phosphatase calcineurin in C. neoformans but not in S. cerevisiae. These results indicate that conserved signaling pathways serve both similar and divergent cellular roles in morphogenesis in these divergent organisms.</em></small><br>[ID: 16775005]"

A wide range of fungi including ascomycetes, basidiomycetyes, and zygomycetes possesses multiple RNA silencing components in the genome, whereas a portion of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi apparently lacks the whole or most of the components. The number of paralogous silencing proteins in the genome differs considerably among fungal species, suggesting that RNA silencing pathways have diversified significantly during evolution in parallel with developing the complexity of life cycle or in response to environmental conditions. Interestingly, orthologous silencing proteins from different fungal clades are often clustered more closely than paralogous proteins in a fungus, indicating that duplication events occurred before speciation events. Therefore, the origin of multiple RNA silencing pathways seems to be very ancient, likely having occurred prior to the divergence of the major fungal lineages.</em></small><br>[ID: 16786437]"

Li G, Osborne J, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The pathogen Heterobasidion parviporum causes significant losses to forest industries in Europe and North America. The fungus is spread by basidiospores on fresh stumps where it differentiates into a specialized infection hyphae to colonize its host.

To investigate gene expression pattern during the spore germination stages, mRNA of germinated and ungerminated conidiospores of H. parviporum harvested at distinct developmental time points (18, 36, 72 and 120 h) corresponding to periods of isotropic/germ tube emergence, polarized apical, early and late mycelial lateral branching growth stages was hybridized to macroarrays containing 338 cDNAs from H. parviporum. The results of the statistical analysis identified a total of 24, 39, 38 and 30 genes that were differentially upregulated at 18, 36, 72 and 120 h, respectively, relative to time 0. The number of the downregulated genes was 4, 6, 8 and 13 genes respectively. During isotropic, polarized and mycelial growth stages, majority of the differentially expressed genes belonged to functional categories metabolism (21-32%) and protein formation (21-30%). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time-PCR) data essentially confirmed the macroarray analyses. The real-time-PCR result showed that transcript levels of genes involved in glucose metabolism (phosphoglucomutase), amino acid metabolism (arginase, delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, sulfur metabolism-negative regulator, imidazoleglycerol phosphate dehydratase) and protein synthesis (40S ribosomal protein S15) were significantly increased during polarized growth (36 h) stage but decreased at early and late stages of mycelial growth (72-120 h). An understanding of the various molecular and physiological processes during the development of H. parviporum spores is an important step towards the goal of identifying novel antifungal strategies.</em></small><br>[ID: 16872398]"

The cDNA sequences contained open reading frames of 1,389 base pairs (bp) (bgl1A) and 1,623 bp (bgl1B), encoding 462 and 530 amino acids, respectively. Although high sequence identity (65%) was observed between the deduced amino acid sequences of the two enzymes, an apparent difference was observed at the C-terminal region: BGL1B has a 63-amino acid extension, which has no similarity with any known protein. Both recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli showed hydrolytic activity towards several beta-glycosidic compounds. However, the substrate recognition patterns of the two enzymes were quite different from each other. In particular, cellobiose was hydrolyzed more effectively by BGL1B than by BGL1A. The expression of the two genes in the fungus was monitored by reverse transcription-PCR, which showed that bgl1A was expressed constitutively in both glucose- and cellobiose-containing culture, whereas bgl1B was expressed in cellobiose culture but was repressed in glucose culture, possibly because of carbon catabolite repression.

Paterson RR<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ganoderma is a basidiomycete white rot fungus which has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries particularly in China, Japan and Korea. A great deal of work has been carried out on Ganoderma lucidum. The common names for preparations include Lingzhi, Munnertake, Sachitake, Reishi and Youngzhi. This review collates the publications detailing activities and compounds by representative species whilst considering the most valid claims of effectiveness. The biological activities reported of preparations from Ganoderma are remarkable and given most emphasis herein as distinct from structure/activity information. The metabolites consist of mainly polysaccharides and terpenoids. Many are activities against the major diseases of our time and so the present review is of great importance. The list of effects is huge ranging from anti-cancer to relieving blockages of the bladder. However, the reports have not all been tested scientifically with the convincing evidence is reserved for assays of pure compounds. It is a prime example of an ancient remedy being of great relevance to the modern era. There does appear to be an assumption that the therapeutic effects attributed to the fungus have been proven. The next step is to produce some effective medicines which may be hampered by problems of mass production.</em></small><br>[ID: 16905165]"

Broeker K, Fehser S, Moerschbacher BM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We have isolated and characterised the first set of chitin synthase genes from a rust fungus, a large group of economically highly important, obligately biotrophic plant pathogens. Puccinia graminis was used as a model organism for the rust fungi which are not well investigated on the molecular level today. One of the major structural components of most fungal cell walls is the chitin polymer which is synthesised by a family of enzymes called chitin synthases. In P. graminis, we have isolated five new chitin synthase genes from four different classes, chsII, chsIIIa, chsIIIb, chsIV, and chsV. The genes contain a high number of introns, unusual for other known fungal chitin synthases. The dinucleic stage of the fungus seems to contain two slightly different genes or alleles for four isoforms. One isoform, chsIIIa, seems to be expressed only in the youngest stages of fungal growth. Analysis of the derived proteins shows that together with other basidiomycete CHS, the pgtCHS form separate subgroups in the phylogenetic tree. This set of five rust chitin synthase genes, with some unusual features compared to known fungal chitin synthases, allows new insights into chitin synthase classification, and may help in the development of novel functional fungicides.</em></small><br>[ID: 16924501]"

Fungal laccases are involved in ecologically important processes such as decomposition of lignocellulose (wood and plant material). In this work, in order to find out the role of fungal laccases upon wood colonisation and lignin decay, we describe expression of laccase-encoding genes in the white rot basidiomycete Phlebia radiata 79, when the fungus grows on its natural substrates, that is on softwood (Alnus incana) and hardwood (Picea abies). Clones for two laccase-encoding genes, the previously described Pr-lac1 and a new gene Pr-lac2 were characterized. Pr-lac2 coding region is interrupted by 12 introns and the deduced Lac2 protein displays a higher pI value (5.8) than Lac1 (pI 3.2-3.5). Phylogenetic analysis indicates differential evolution for the two laccases, and Lac2 demonstrates the highest sequence identity with Trametes laccases (66%). Transcripts of Pr-lac1 were the most abundant both in solid-state softwood and semi-solid hardwood cultures, as analyzed by competitive RT-PCR and Northern hybridization. On spruce wood chips, Pr-lac1 and Pr-lac2 were expressed within 2-3 weeks of growth together with manganese and lignin peroxidase-encoding genes.

Idnurm A, Giles SS, Perfect JR, Heitman J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The function of the peroxisomes was examined in the pathogenic basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans. Recent studies reveal the glyoxylate pathway is required for virulence of diverse microbial pathogens of plants and animals. One exception is C. neoformans, in which isocitrate lyase (encoded by ICL1) was previously shown not to be required for virulence, and here this was extended to exclude also a role for malate synthase (encoded by MLS1). The role of peroxisomes, in which the glyoxylate pathway enzymes are localized in many organisms, was examined by mutation of two genes (PEX1 and PEX6) encoding AAA (ATPases associated with various cellular activities)-type proteins required for peroxisome formation. The pex1 and pex6 deletion mutants were unable to localize the fluorescent DsRED-SKL protein to peroxisomal punctate structures, in contrast to wild-type cells. pex1 and pex6 single mutants and a pex1 pex6 double mutant exhibit identical phenotypes, including abolished growth on fatty acids but no growth difference on acetate. Because both icl1 and mls1 mutants are unable to grow on acetate as the sole carbon source, these findings demonstrate that the glyoxylate pathway can function efficiently outside the peroxisome in C. neoformans. The pex1 mutant exhibits wild-type virulence in a murine inhalation model and in an insect host, demonstrating that peroxisomes are not required for virulence under these conditions. An unusual phenotype of the pex1 and pex6 mutants was that they grew poorly with glucose as the carbon source, but nearly wild type with galactose, which suggested impaired hexokinase function and that C. neoformans peroxisomes might function analogously to the glycosomes of the trypanosomid parasites. Deletion of the hexokinase HXK2 gene reduced growth in the presence of glucose and suppressed the growth defect of the pex1 mutant on glucose. The hexokinase 2 protein of C. neoformans contains a predicted peroxisome targeting signal (type 2) motif; however, Hxk2 fused to fluorescent proteins was not localized to peroxisomes. Thus, we hypothesize that glucose or glycolytic metabolites are utilized in the peroxisome by an as yet unidentified enzyme or regulate a pathway required by the fungus in the absence of peroxisomes.</em></small><br>[ID: 17041184]"

It is the first structure of a non-specific 1,3(4)-beta-D-glucanase from glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16). P. chrysosporium is a wood-degrading basidiomycete fungus and Lam16A is the predominant extracellular protein expressed when laminarin is used as the sole carbon source. The protein folds into a curved beta-sandwich homologous to those of other known GH16 enzyme structures (especially kappa-carrageenase from Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovora and beta-agarase from Zobelia galactanivorans). A notable likeness is also evident with the related glycoside hydrolase family 7 (GH7) enzymes. A mammalian lectin, p58/ERGIC, as well as polysaccharide lyase (PL7) enzymes also showed significant similarity to Lam16A. The enzyme has two potential N-glycosylation sites. One such site, at Asn43, displayed a branched heptasaccharide sufficiently stabilized to be interpreted from the X-ray diffraction data.

Whole genome sequencing of this fungus has revealed the presence of the largest P450ome in fungi comprising approx. 150 P450 genes, most of which have unknown function. On the basis of our genome-wide structural and evolutionary analysis, these P450 genes could be classified into 12 families and 23 subfamilies and under 11 fungal P450 clans.

This basidiomycete fungus does not use aggressive virulence strategies to kill its host. U. maydis belongs to the group of biotrophic parasites (the smuts) that depend on living tissue for proliferation and development. Here we report the genome sequence for a member of this economically important group of biotrophic fungi. The 20.5-million-base U. maydis genome assembly contains 6,902 predicted protein-encoding genes and lacks pathogenicity signatures found in the genomes of aggressive pathogenic fungi, for example a battery of cell-wall-degrading enzymes. However, we detected unexpected genomic features responsible for the pathogenicity of this organism. Specifically, we found 12 clusters of genes encoding small secreted proteins with unknown function. A significant fraction of these genes exists in small gene families. Expression analysis showed that most of the genes contained in these clusters are regulated together and induced in infected tissue. Deletion of individual clusters altered the virulence of U. maydis in five cases, ranging from a complete lack of symptoms to hypervirulence. Despite years of research into the mechanism of pathogenicity in U. maydis, no 'true' virulence factors had been previously identified. Thus, the discovery of the secreted protein gene clusters and the functional demonstration of their decisive role in the infection process illuminate previously unknown mechanisms of pathogenicity operating in biotrophic fungi. Genomic analysis is, similarly, likely to open up new avenues for the discovery of virulence determinants in other pathogens.</em></small><br>[ID: 17080091]"

Strains of this species belong to one of two mating types: mating type a (MATa) or mating type alpha (MATalpha). In typical crosses between MATa and MATalpha strains, the progeny inherit mitochondria from the MATa parent. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. To help elucidate the molecular mechanisms, we examined the effects of four environmental factors on the patterns of mtDNA inheritance. These factors are temperature, UV irradiation, and the addition of either the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-adc) or the ubiquitination inhibitor ammonium chloride. Except temperature, the other three factors have been shown to influence organelle inheritance during sexual mating in other eukaryotes. Our results indicate that while the application of 5-adc or ammonium chloride did not influence mtDNA inheritance in C. neoformans, both UV irradiation and high temperature treatments did. Progeny from a cross involving a high temperature-sensitive mutant with the calcineurin subunit A gene deleted showed biparental mtDNA inheritance in all examined temperatures, consistent with a role of calcineurin and temperature in mtDNA inheritance. Furthermore, the zygote progeny population from a cross performed at a high-temperature environment had a greater variability in their vegetative fitness than that from the same cross conducted at a low temperature. Our results indicate a potentially adaptive role of biparental mtDNA inheritance and mtDNA recombination in certain environments in C. neoformans.</em></small><br>[ID: 17092744]"

Miyazaki Y, Hiraide M, Shibuya H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Several functional genes encoding putative proteins, heat shock protein 70, sphingosine phosphate lyase, and Na+/H+ antiporter, were cloned from the basidiomycete Fomitopsis pinicola, a wood-rotting fungus isolated in the tropical mangrove forest of Pohnpei Island of the Federated States of Micronesia. The deduced amino acid sequences of the obtained genes involved in heat shock resistance, lipid synthesis, and salt tolerance showed diverse similarities to other homologous proteins. Molecular phylogenetic trees of these proteins suggested that encoded proteins of the cloned genes of F. pinicola differed remarkably from other homologs in various organisms, even fungal proteins. Putative candidates for other genes related to several cellular metabolisms were also amplified, implying the possible existence of those genes in F. pinicola. This is the first report of possibly functional genes derived from a basidiomycetous mushroom growing in tropical islands such as Micronesia. The genes found in this study might play important roles in the cellular survival of the basidiomycete F. pinicola under severe environmental conditions.</em></small><br>[ID: 17213639]"

Kujawa M, Volc J, Halada P, Sedmera P, Divne C, Sygmund C, Leitner C, Peterbauer C, Haltrich D<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We purified an extracellular pyranose dehydrogenase (PDH) from the basidiomycete fungus Agaricus xanthoderma using ammonium sulfate fractionation and ion-exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The native enzyme is a monomeric glycoprotein (5% carbohydrate) containing a covalently bound FAD as its prosthetic group. The PDH polypeptide consists of 575 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 65 400 Da as determined by MALDI MS. On the basis of the primary structure of the mature protein, PDH is a member of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family. We constructed a homology model of PDH using the 3D structure of glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger as a template. This model suggests a novel type of bi-covalent flavinylation in PDH, 9-S-cysteinyl, 8-alpha-N3-histidyl FAD. The enzyme exhibits a broad sugar substrate tolerance, oxidizing structurally different aldopyranoses including monosaccharides and oligosaccharides as well as glycosides. Its preferred electron donor substrates are D-glucose, D-galactose, L-arabinose, and D-xylose. As shown by in situ NMR analysis, D-glucose and D-galactose are both oxidized at positions C2 and C3, yielding the corresponding didehydroaldoses (diketoaldoses) as the final reaction products. PDH shows no detectable activity with oxygen, and its reactivity towards electron acceptors is rather limited, reducing various substituted benzoquinones and complexed metal ions. The azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) cation radical and the ferricenium ion are the best electron acceptors, as judged by the catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(m)). The enzyme may play a role in lignocellulose degradation.</em></small><br>[ID: 17227387]"

Toda T, Hyakumachi M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Thirty single basidiospore isolates (SBIs) obtained from four field isolates of the basidiomycete fungus Thanatephorus cucumeris AG 2-2 IV were examined for heterokaryon formation. SBIs of three of four field isolates (Rh509, 92155 and R94) did not produce a tuft of mycelium in the hyphal interaction zone between paired isolates on 2% charcoal agar. Field isolates Rh509, 92155 and R94 indicated no death of interacting mycelium with their progenies on glass slide and microscopic examination. AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) phenotypes of parent and their SBIs were identical. Field isolates Rh509, 92155 and R94 and their SBIs were homothallic. SBIs obtained from field isolate SA-1 were grouped into two mating types (SBI-M1 and SBI-M2), and a tuft of mycelium was formed between paired SBIs-M1 and -M2. SBIs of field isolate SA-1 indicated that no death and death of interacting mycelium were randomly observed. AFLP phenotypes among SBIs of isolate SA-1 were not identical and were also different from their parent isolate. AFLP phenotypes of tuft mycelia produced between heterothallic SBI-M1 and -M2 were heterokaryotic. The mating system of field isolate SA-1 and its SBIs was heterothallic. Both SBIs-M1 and -M2 further produced tuft mycelium with homothallic field isolates and their SBIs. AFLP banding patterns suggested that tuft mycelium was heterokaryotic produced from between heterothallic and homothallic isolates. Results from these experiments clarified that both homothallic and heterothallic isolates exist in population of T. cucumeris AG 2-2 IV, and that genetic exchange can occur between homothallic and heterothallic isolates.</em></small><br>[ID: 17256576]"

Shahollari B, Vadassery J, Varma A, Oelmüller R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Piriformospora indica, a basidiomycete of the Sebacinaceae family, promotes the growth, development and seed production of a variety of plant species. Arabidopsis plants colonized with the fungus produce 22% more seeds than uncolonized plants. Deactivating the Arabidopsis single-copy gene DMI-1, which encodes an ion carrier required for mycorrihiza formation in legumes, does not affect the beneficial interaction between the two symbiotic partners. We used cellular and molecular responses initiated during the establishment of the interaction between P. indica and Arabidopsis roots to isolate mutants that fail to respond to the fungus. An ethylmethane sulfonate mutant (Piriformospora indica-insensitive-2; pii-2), and a corresponding insertion line, are impaired in a leucine-rich repeat protein (At1g13230). The protein pii-2, which contains a putative endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, is also found in Triton X-100-insoluble plasma membrane microdomains, suggesting that it is present in the endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane continuum in Arabidopsis roots. The microdomains also contain an atypical receptor protein (At5g16590) containing leucine-rich repeats, the message of which is transiently upregulated in Arabidopsis roots in response to P. indica. This response is not detectable in At1g13230 mutants, and the protein is not detectable in the At1g13230 mutant microdomains. Partial deactivation of a gene for a sphingosine kinase, which is required for the biosynthesis of sphingolipid found in plasma membrane microdomains, also affects the Arabidopsis/P. indica interaction. Thus, pii-2, and presumably also At5g16590, two proteins present in plasma membrane microdomains, appear to be involved in P. indica-induced growth promotion and enhanced seed production in Arabidopsis thaliana.</em></small><br>[ID: 17397506]"

Slot JC, Hallstrom KN, Matheny PB, Hibbett DS<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We investigated the origin and diversification of the high-affinity nitrate transporter NRT2 in fungi and other eukaryotes using Bayesian and maximum parsimony methods. To assess the higher-level relationships and origins of NRT2 in eukaryotes, we analyzed 200 amino acid sequences from the Nitrate/Nitrite Porter (NNP) Family (to which NRT2 belongs), including 55 fungal, 41 viridiplantae (green plants), 11 heterokonts (stramenopiles), and 87 bacterial sequences. To assess evolution of NRT2 within fungi and other eukaryotes, we analyzed 116 amino acid sequences of NRT2 from 58 fungi, 40 viridiplantae (green plants), 1 rhodophyte, and 5 heterokonts, rooted with 12 bacterial sequences. Our results support a single origin of eukaryotic NRT2 from 1 of several clades of mostly proteobacterial NNP transporters. The phylogeny of bacterial NNP transporters does not directly correspond with bacterial taxonomy, apparently due to ancient duplications and/or horizontal gene transfer events. The distribution of NRT2 in the eukaryotes is patchy, but the NRT2 phylogeny nonetheless supports the monophyly of major groups such as viridiplantae, flowering plants, monocots, and eudicots, as well as fungi, ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, and agaric mushrooms. At least 1 secondary origin of eukaryotic NRT2 via horizontal transfer to the fungi is suggested, possibly from a heterokont donor. Our analyses also suggest that there has been a horizontal transfer of nrt2 from a basidiomycete fungus to an ascomycete fungus and reveal a duplication of nrt2 in the ectomycorrhizal mushroom genus, Hebeloma.</em></small><br>[ID: 17513882]"

Xu J, Guo H, Yang ZL<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are becoming increasingly popular markers for studying a variety of biological phenomena. This paper describes the development and analysis of a set of SNP markers for the basidiomycete fungus Tricholoma matsutake. T. matsutake is a gourmet mycorrhizal mushroom primarily associated with pine forests. However, little is known about its genetics and genomic variation, including SNP variation. To identify and analyse SNPs in T. matsutake, a genomic library was constructed and >72,000 nt were analysed from >200 random clones. Primers from 20 sequenced fragments were then designed to amplify and sequence >10,000 bp sequences from the original strain, from which the genomic library was constructed, as well as another strain from >350 km away; both strains were from south-western China. These two strains had similar intra-strain SNP frequencies (1.104 and 1.278 % per nucleotide, respectively). The combined analysis revealed that 14 of the 20 examined fragments contained SNPs, ranging from two to 47 per fragment, and yielding a total of 178 SNPs out of the 10 428 sequenced nucleotides (an SNP frequency of 1.707 %). Among the 178 SNPs, one site had three alternative nucleotides, while the remaining 177 had two each, with 148 transitions and 29 transversions, resulting in a combined transition to transversion ratio of 5.1. In addition, the haplotype phases of all SNPs within individual fragments for both strains were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of these haplotypes revealed three kinds of haplotype relationship, including haplotype sharing both within and between strains. Furthermore, a subset of the SNPs detectable by restriction enzyme digests was screened for its distribution among 31 additional wild strains from five distinct locations in south-western China. The implications of these SNPs and haplotypes for our understanding of the genetics, population history, ecology and evolution of this important mushroom species are discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 17600046]"

Garbelotto M, Gonthier P, Nicolotti G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The ability of two closely related species to maintain species boundaries in spite of retained interfertility between them is a documented driving force of speciation. Experimental evidence to support possible interspecific postzygotic isolation mechanisms for organisms belonging to the kingdom Fungi is still missing. Here we report on the outcome of a series of controlled comparative inoculation experiments of parental wild genotypes and F(1) hybrid genotypes between closely related and interfertile taxa within the Heterobasidion annosum fungal species complex. Results indicated that these fungal hybrids are not genetically unfit but can fare as well as parental genotypes when inoculated on substrates favorable to both parents. However, when placed in substrates favoring one of the parents, hybrids are less competitive than the parental genotypes specialized on that substrate. Furthermore, in some but not all fungus x plant combinations, a clear asymmetry in fitness was observed between hybrids carrying identical nuclear genomes but different cytoplasms. This work provides some of the first experimental evidence of ecologically driven postzygotic reinforcement of isolation between closely related fungal species characterized by marked host specificity. Host specialization is one of the most striking traits of a large number of symbiotic and parasitic fungi; thus, we suggest the ecological mechanism proven here to reinforce isolation among Heterobasidion spp. may be generally valid for host-specialized fungi. The validity of this generalization is supported by the low number of known fungal hybrids and by their distinctive feature of being found in substrates different from those colonized by parental species.</em></small><br>[ID: 17660300]"

The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic population structures of P. centrifuga in both continuous and fragmented habitats, and estimate the potential impact of fragmentation on the genetic diversity of the fungus. Three hundred fifteen single spore isolates (representing 47 spore families and 33 single isolates) from eight populations across northern Europe (Russia, Finland, and Sweden) were screened with seven microsatellite markers and arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction with the M13 minisatellite. The two molecular methods generally gave the same pattern for the genetic population structure. There were no significant differences between the observed and the expected heterozygosities, and the inbreeding coefficient (FIS) did not indicate any inbreeding. The fixation index (FST) revealed a general pattern with little to moderate genetic differentiation for the majority of populations, while the southernmost Swedish population Norra Kvill was the only one showing high differentiation from about half of the other populations. Swedish population Fiby with the shortest distance to the continuous habitat was moderately differentiated from most of the others and to the largest extent differed from geographically closest population of Norra Kvill. The results indicate that the fragmentation of old-growth forest in Russia and Finland is more recent than the fragmentation in Sweden, and the genetic population structures of P. centrifuga in northern Europe might be related to differences in forest landscape dynamics between the two areas.</em></small><br>[ID: 17688536]"

Horst RJ, Engelsdorf T, Sonnewald U, Voll LM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The Basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis is the common agent of corn smut and is capable of inducing gall growth on infected tissue of the C4 plant maize (Zea mays). While U. maydis is very well characterized on the genetic level, the physiological changes in the host plant in response to U. maydis infection have not been studied in detail, yet. Therefore, we examined the influence of U. maydis infection on photosynthetic performance and carbon metabolism in maize leaf galls. At all stages of development, U. maydis-induced leaf galls exhibited carbon dioxide response curves, CO2 compensation points and enzymatic activities that are characteristic of C3 photosynthesis, demonstrating that the establishment of C4 metabolism is prevented in infected tissue. Hexose contents and hexose/sucrose ratio of leaf galls remained high at 6 days post infection, while a shift in free sugar metabolism was observed in the uninfected controls at that time point. Concomitantly, transitory starch production and sucrose accumulation during the light period remained low in leaf galls. Given that U. maydis is infectious on young developing tissue, the observed changes in carbohydrate metabolism suggest that the pathogen manipulates the developing leaf tissue to arrest sink-to-source transition in favor of maintaining sink metabolism in the host cells. Furthermore, evidence is presented that carbohydrate supply during the biotrophic phase of the pathogen is assured by a fungal invertase.</em></small><br>[ID: 17689830]"

Manubens A, Canessa P, Folch C, Avila M, Salas L, Vicuña R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The authors have previously identified and characterized lcs, a gene encoding laccase in the white-rot basidiomycete Ceriporiopsis subvermispora. In this work, the effect of Mn2+ in the production of extracellular laccase in liquid cultures of this fungus has been assessed. It was observed that at low (0-10 microM) concentrations of Mn2+, high titers of lcs-mRNA were obtained, whereas at high (160-194 microM) concentrations of this metal ion, transcripts levels decreased markedly. This phenomenon was observed at different days of growth. On the other hand, Cu2+ or Ag+, but not Zn2+ or Cd2+, led to an accumulation of lcs transcripts only in cultures grown in the absence of Mn2+. A dramatic increase in lcs transcript levels was also obtained with syringic acid, a lignin-related aromatic compound. This effect was more pronounced in cultures lacking Mn2+. In the course of these studies it was observed that Mn2+ stimulates mycelium growth. Thus, although extracellular laccase activity appeared higher in cultures containing 160 or 194 microM Mn2+, i.e. when lcs transcripts were lower, a correlation between lcs-mRNA levels and enzymatic activity was observed when values of the latter were corrected by the amount of mycelium present in the cultures.</em></small><br>[ID: 17711455]"

In order to promote laccase production, P. rivulosus was cultivated in nutrient-nitrogen sufficient liquid media containing either charcoal or spruce sawdust as supplements. Two laccases with distinct pI values, Lac-3.5 and Lac-4.8, were purified from peptone-spruce sawdust-charcoal cultures of P. rivulosus. Both laccases showed thermal stability at up to 60 degrees C. Lac-4.8 was thermally activated at 50 degrees C. Surprisingly, both laccases displayed atypically low pH optima (pH 3.0-3.5) in oxidation of the commonly used laccase substrates syringaldazine (4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde azine), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol). Steady-state kinetic measurements pointed to unusually low affinity to guaiacol at low pH, whereas the kinetic constants for the methoxyphenols and ABTS were within the ranges reported for other fungal laccases. The combination of thermotolerance with low pH optima for methoxylated phenol substrates suggests that the two P. rivulosus T241i laccases possess potential for use in biotechnological applications.</em></small><br>[ID: 17805527]"

Comparison of the total amino acid composition of this laccase with several fungal laccases indicated dissimilarity in the proportion of some basic and hydrophobic amino acids. Analysis of the circular dichroism spectrum of the protein indicated 37% alpha-helical, 26% beta-sheet and 38% random coil content which differed significantly from that in the solved structures of other laccases, which contain higher beta-sheet structures. The critical role of the carboxylic group containing amino acids was demonstrated by determining the kinetic parameters at different pH and this was confirmed by the observation that a critical Asp is strongly conserved in both Ascomycete and Basidiomycete laccases. The enzyme was denatured in the presence of a number of denaturing agents and refolded back to functional state with copper.

GB 4-2 promoted mycelial growth of the phytopathogenic fungus, germination rate of fungal spores, extension of germ tubes and early colonization of outer cortical layers of the plant root. Reduced colonization of the inner cortical cell layers was accompanied by the induction of cell wall appositions, and increased xylem formation in the vascular cylinder emerged after bacterium-fungus coinoculation. Bacterial treatment led to decreased water content in roots and needles and increased photosynthetic yield (F(v)/F(m)) and peroxidase activities in needles.

Wang Y, Zeng F, Hon CC, Zhang Y, Leung FC<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In this study, the full mitochondrial genome of a basidiomycete fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus, was sequenced and analyzed. It is a circular DNA molecule of 73 242 bp and contains 44 known genes encoding 18 proteins and 26 RNA genes. The protein-coding genes include 14 common mitochondrial genes, one ribosomal small subunit protein 3 gene, one RNA polymerase gene and two DNA polymerase genes. In addition, one RNA and one DNA polymerase genes were identified in a mitochondrial plasmid. These two genes show relatively low similarities to their homologs in the mitochondrial genome but they are nearly identical to the known mitochondrial plasmid genes from another Pleurotus ostreatus strain. This suggests that the plasmid may mediate the horizontal gene transfer of the DNA and RNA polymerase genes into mitochondrial genome, and such a transfer may be an ancient event. Phylogenetic analysis based on the cox1 ORFs verified the traditional classification of Pleurotus ostreatus among fungi. However, the discordances were observed in the phylogenetic trees based on the six cox1 intronic ORFs of Pleurotus ostreatus and their homologs in other species, suggesting that these intronic ORFs are foreign DNA sequences obtained through HGT.

These constructs are then used to produce deletion mutants in the organism of interest following applicable methods for that species. In establishing this protocol we determined empirically that 1 kb was a suitable flank length to facilitate homologous recombination in our species of interest, Ustilago maydis. The method, which we have named DelsGate (Deletions via Gateway), consists of standard PCR of only the 5' and 3' 1 kb gene flanks directly followed by in vitro Gateway cloning and final generation of the circular deletion construct by in vivo recombination in Escherichia coli. For use in DelsGate we have modified a Gateway cloning vector to include selectable markers for transformation of Ascomycetes and the Basidiomycete fungus U. maydis which causes corn smut disease. We have tested the reproducibility of the DelsGate approach by generating deletion constructs for 12 U. maydis genes. Although not tested here, the PCR and transformation steps of DelsGate should be well suited for high-throughput approaches to gene deletion construction in fungal species.

The market prospect in the nutraceutics industries for this health-protective molecule is very promising.

Astaxanthin is also produced by the yeast-like basidiomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. A gene crtS involved in the conversion of beta-carotene to astaxanthin has been cloned simultaneously by two research groups. Complementation studies of X. dendrorhous mutants and expression analysis in Mucor circinelloides reveals that the CrtS enzyme is a beta-carotene hydroxylase of the P-450 monooxygenase family that converts beta-carotene to the hydroxylated derivatives beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, but it does not form astaxanthin or the ketolated intermediates in this fungus. A bifunctional beta-carotene hydroxylase-ketolase activity has been proposed for the CrtS protein. The evidence for and against this hypothesis is analyzed in detail in this review.</em></small><br>[ID: 18289382]"

Lopes MA, Gomes DS, Koblitz MG, Pirovani CP, Cascardo JC, Góes-Neto A, Micheli F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We report here the first analysis of chitinase regulation in Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of the witches' broom disease of cacao. A multivariate statistical approach was employed to evaluate the effect of several variables, including carbon and nitrogen sources and cultivation time, on M. perniciosa non-secreted (detected in mycelium, i.e. in symplasm and cell wall) and secreted (detected in the culture medium) chitinase activities. Non-secreted chitinase activity was enhanced by peptone and chitin and repressed by glucose. Chitinase secretion was increased by yeast extract alone or in combination with other nitrogen sources, and by N-acetylglucosamine, and repressed in presence of chitin. The best cultivation times for non-secreted and secreted chitinase activities were 30 and 20 d, respectively. However, chitinase activity was always higher in the mycelium than in the culture medium, suggesting a relatively poor chitinase secretion activity. Conversely, higher mycelial growth was observed when the activity of the non-secreted chitinase was at its lowest, i.e. when the fungus was grown on glucose and yeast extract as sources of carbon and nitrogen, respectively. Conversely, the induction of non-secreted chitinase activity by chitin decreased the mycelium growth. These results suggest that the culture medium, by the induction or repression of chitinases, affected the hyphal growth. Thus, as an essential component of M. perniciosa growth, chitinases may be a potential target for strategies to control disease.</em></small><br>[ID: 18308529]"

Frisvad JC, Andersen B, Thrane U<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A secondary metabolite is a chemical compound produced by a limited number of fungal species in a genus, an order, or even phylum. A profile of secondary metabolites consists of all the different compounds a fungus can produce on a given substratum and includes toxins, antibiotics and other outward-directed compounds. Chemotaxonomy is traditionally restricted to comprise fatty acids, proteins, carbohydrates, or secondary metabolites, but has sometimes been defined so broadly that it also includes DNA sequences. It is not yet possible to use secondary metabolites in phylogeny, because of the inconsistent distribution throughout the fungal kingdom. However, this is the very quality that makes secondary metabolites so useful in classification and identification. Four groups of organisms are particularly good producers of secondary metabolites: plants, fungi, lichen fungi, and actinomycetes, whereas yeasts, protozoa, and animals are less efficient producers. Therefore, secondary metabolites have mostly been used in plant and fungal taxonomy, whereas chemotaxonomy has been neglected in bacteriology. Lichen chemotaxonomy has been based on few biosynthetic families (chemosyndromes), whereas filamentous fungi have been analysed for a wide array of terpenes, polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, and combinations of these. Fungal chemotaxonomy based on secondary metabolites has been used successfully in large ascomycete genera such as Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Hypoxylon, Penicillium, Stachybotrys, Xylaria and in few basidiomycete genera, but not in Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota.</em></small><br>[ID: 18319145]"

Boreal, temperate and montane forests all depend on ectomycorrhizae. Identification of the primary factors that regulate symbiotic development and metabolic activity will therefore open the door to understanding the role of ectomycorrhizae in plant development and physiology, allowing the full ecological significance of this symbiosis to be explored. Here we report the genome sequence of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor (Fig. 1) and highlight gene sets involved in rhizosphere colonization and symbiosis. This 65-megabase genome assembly contains approximately 20,000 predicted protein-encoding genes and a very large number of transposons and repeated sequences. We detected unexpected genomic features, most notably a battery of effector-type small secreted proteins (SSPs) with unknown function, several of which are only expressed in symbiotic tissues. The most highly expressed SSP accumulates in the proliferating hyphae colonizing the host root. The ectomycorrhizae-specific SSPs probably have a decisive role in the establishment of the symbiosis. The unexpected observation that the genome of L. bicolor lacks carbohydrate-active enzymes involved in degradation of plant cell walls, but maintains the ability to degrade non-plant cell wall polysaccharides, reveals the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots. The predicted gene inventory of the L. bicolor genome, therefore, points to previously unknown mechanisms of symbiosis operating in biotrophic mycorrhizal fungi. The availability of this genome provides an unparalleled opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the processes by which symbionts interact with plants within their ecosystem to perform vital functions in the carbon and nitrogen cycles that are fundamental to sustainable plant productivity.</em></small><br>[ID: 18322534]"

Ryu SH, Lee AY, Kim M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Two laccase cDNAs, pblac1 and pblac2, were cloned from a white-rot fungus strain, Polyporus brumalis (KFRI 20912). The cloned cDNAs consisted of 1,829 bp and 1,804 bp, and their open reading frames encoded proteins of 520 and 524 amino acids, with calculated molecular masses of approximately 55.9 kDa and 56 kDa, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of each protein showed 70% similarity. The copper binding regions were conserved in both proteins, as in other fungal laccases. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcript levels of the two laccases increased progressively in shallow stationary culture liquid medium. The transcript level of each laccase was induced when the fungus was exposed to di-butyl phthalate (DBP), suggesting that the two laccases are involved in DBP degradation. The overexpression of the pblac1 gene was derived by the promoter of a gene for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, using a homologous system. The activity of laccase in the transformants was significantly higher than that of the wild type. The identification of these laccase cDNAs was a first step to characterize the molecular events related to the lignin degradation ability of this basidiomycetous fungus, as well as the degradation of many recalcitrant xenobiotics.</em></small><br>[ID: 18337695]"

Tlalka M, Fricker M, Watkinson S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>alpha-Aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) is a nonmetabolized amino acid analogue of alanine, which at low (muM) concentrations acts as a tracer for amino acid movements. At high concentrations (mM), it competitively inhibits membrane transport and metabolism of protein amino acids and acts as a systemic translocated inhibitor of mycelial extension in fungi. AIB can control mycelial spread of the basidiomycete Serpula lacrymans, the cause of brown rot of wood in buildings. However, it is not known how effectively the inhibitor is distributed throughout the mycelium. Realistically heterogeneous microcosms, in which the fungus grew across nutritionally inert sand to colonize discrete wood resources, were used to investigate patterns of inhibition and translocation following local application of AIB. At a 0.1 M concentration, locally applied AIB caused immediate arrest of extension throughout the whole mycelium, maintained for a 6-week experimental period. The dynamics of translocation of subtoxic amounts of [1-(14)C]AIB ([(14)C]AIB) were mapped by photon-counting scintillation imaging in conjunction with destructive harvest to establish the velocity, direction, and rate of translocation and the extent of [(14)C]AIB reallocation accompanying the invasion of fresh wood. Locally applied [(14)C]AIB was distributed throughout complex mycelial networks within 2 h of application, becoming localized in growing margins by 12 h. Encounter with a fresh wood resource triggered a widespread response, causing withdrawal of [(14)C]AIB from throughout the network, accompanied by accumulation in the newly colonized wood and associated mycelium. The results are discussed in the context of nutrient dynamics in wood decomposer fungi and the mechanism of the amino acid reallocation response.</em></small><br>[ID: 18344339]"

Rodrigues A, Bacci M Jr, Mueller UG, Ortiz A, Pagnocca FC<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Leafcutter ants (Formicidae: tribe Attini) are well-known insects that cultivate basidiomycete fungi (Agaricales: Lepiotaceae) as their principal food. Fungus gardens are monocultures of a single cultivar strain, but they also harbor a diverse assemblage of additional microbes with largely unknown roles in the symbiosis. Cultivar-attacking microfungi in the genus Escovopsis are specialized parasites found only in association with attine gardens. Evolutionary theory predicts that the low genetic diversity in monocultures should render ant gardens susceptible to a wide range of diseases, and additional parasites with roles similar to that of Escovopsis are expected to exist. We profiled the diversity of cultivable microfungi found in 37 nests from ten Acromyrmex species from Southern Brazil and compared this diversity to published surveys. Our study revealed a total of 85 microfungal strains. Fusarium oxysporum and Escovopsis were the predominant species in the surveyed gardens, infecting 40.5% and 27% of the nests, respectively. No specific relationship existed regarding microfungal species and ant-host species, ant substrate preference (dicot versus grass) or nesting habit. Molecular data indicated high genetic diversity among Escovopsis isolates. In contrast to the garden parasite, F. oxysporum strains are not specific parasites of the cultivated fungus because strains isolated from attine gardens have similar counterparts found in the environment. Overall, the survey indicates that saprophytic microfungi are prevalent in South American leafcutter ants. We discuss the antagonistic potential of these microorganisms as \"weeds\" in the ant-fungus symbiosis.</em></small><br>[ID: 18369523]"

Cells exhibited increased resistance to H(2)O(2) when shifted from glucose to glycerol and from glycerol to glycerol. When exposed to paraquat, cells grown in fresh medium were always more resistant. Apparently glycerol and/or fresh media, but not old glucose media, up-regulate oxidative stress defenses in this fungus. For the mutagens UVC and 4NQO, whose prime action on DNA is not via ROS, change of carbon source did not elicit a clear change in sensitivity/resistance.

The results were compared with separate studies investigating pine interactions with a pathogen, Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. sensu stricto and an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, Laccaria bicolor Maire (Orton). Global changes in the expression of 2109 conifer genes were assayed 1, 5 and 15 days after inoculation. Gene expression data from a cDNA microarray were analyzed by the 2-interconnected mixed linear model statistical approach. The total number of genes differentially expressed compared with the uninfected control was similar after challenge with the pathogen and the ectomycorrhizal symbiont, but the number of differentially expressed genes increased over time for H. annosum, and decreased for L. bicolor. Inoculation of pine roots with T. aureoviride resulted overall in a much lower number of genes with changed transcript levels compared with inoculation with H. annosum or L. bicolor. Functional classification of the differentially expressed genes revealed that the ectomycorrhizal fungus triggered transient induction of defence-related genes. The response and induction of defence against the pathogen was delayed and the magnitude increased over time. Thus, there were specific transcriptional responses depending on whether the conifer roots were challenged with mutualistic, saprotrophic or pathogenic fungi. This suggests that pine trees are able to recognize diverse fungal species and specifically distinguish whether they are pathogenic, neutral or beneficial microbial agents.</em></small><br>[ID: 18381269]"

Generation of these two forms is controlled by two mating type loci, a and b. The fungus undergoes additional morphological transitions in the plant that result in formation of a third cell type, the teliospore. The fuz1 gene is necessary for this developmental program. Here we report cloning and sequencing of fuz1 and show that it contains an open reading frame with coding capacity for a protein of 1421 amino acids. The Fuz1 protein belongs to the family of MYND Zn finger domain proteins. We generate a null mutation in strains of opposite mating type and show that fuz1 is necessary for conjugation tube formation, a morphological transition that occurs in response to pheromones. We generate fuz1- diploid strains heterozygous at a and b and show that fuz1 is also necessary for postfusion events (maintenance of filamentous growth). We also demonstrate that fuz1 is necessary for cell morphogenesis of the yeast-like cell: normal cell length, location and number of septa, cell separation and constriction of the neck region. Fuz1 is also required for cell wall integrity and to prevent secretion of a dark pigment.

The extent of decolorization was monitored at different mediator/dye concentrations and incubation time. Among the synthetic mediators, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was effective at low mediator/dye ratios and resulted in 80-95% decolorization at rates that varied from 226 +/- 4 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) for Reactive Orange 1 to 1,333 +/- 15 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) for Reactive Red 198. Other synthetic mediators like 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and violuric acid showed both concentration- and time-dependent increases in percent decolorization. Natural mediators like vanillin, on the other hand, were found to be less effective on all the dyes except Reactive Orange 1. Computed rates of decolorization were about twofold lower than that with ABTS. The laccase-ABTS system also led to nearly 80% decolorization for the simulated dye mixture. No clear correlation between laccase activity on the mediator and its ability to decolorize dyes was found, but pH had a significant effect: Optimum pH for decolorization coincided with the optimum pH for mediator oxidation. The treated samples were also evaluated for toxicity in model microbial systems. The laccase-mediator system appears promising for treatment of textile wastewaters.</em></small><br>[ID: 18506632]"

The composition of the complex (containing one to four forms of each enzyme) varied during the basidiomycete life cycle. The activity of oxidases was maximal at the stage of nonpigmented mycelium and at the stages of a brown mycelial mat and a fruit body. The activity of tyrosinase increased in the course of mycelium pigmentation and had two maxima: at the stage of a brown mycelial mat and at the stage of a fruit body. Laccase and tyrosinase activities were shown to increase sharply upon addition of oak sawdust extract to the culture medium as compared with the enzyme activities of mycelium grown on wort agar alone.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that GlFPS belonged to the basidiomycete FPS group. Competitive PCR revealed that GlFPS was constitutively expressed in the mycelium growth stage, whereas the transcripts of GlFPS accumulated to high levels rapidly during the process of mushroom primordia. Treatment of mycelia with exogenous methyl jasmonate also caused a large accumulation of GlFPS mRNA. Subsequently, promoter analysis indicated that the 5' upstream region of GlFPS possessed various potential regulatory elements associated with physiological and environmental factors.

Niculita-Hirzel H, Labbé J, Kohler A, le Tacon F, Martin F, Sanders IR, Kües U<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In natural conditions, basidiomycete ectomycorrhizal fungi such as Laccaria bicolor are typically in the dikaryotic state when forming symbioses with trees, meaning that two genetically different individuals have to fuse or 'mate'. Nevertheless, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms of mating in these ecologically important fungi. Here, advantage was taken of the first sequenced genome of the ectomycorrhizal fungus, Laccaria bicolor, to determine the genes that govern the establishment of cell-type identity and orchestrate mating. The L. bicolor mating type loci were identified through genomic screening. The evolutionary history of the genomic regions that contained them was determined by genome-wide comparison of L. bicolor sequences with those of known tetrapolar and bipolar basidiomycete species, and by phylogenetic reconstruction of gene family history. It is shown that the genes of the two mating type loci, A and B, are conserved across the Agaricales, but they are contained in regions of the genome with different evolutionary histories. The A locus is in a region where the gene order is under strong selection across the Agaricales. By contrast, the B locus is in a region where the gene order is likely under a low selection pressure but where gene duplication, translocation and transposon insertion are frequent.</em></small><br>[ID: 18557817]"

Patel H, Gupte A, Gupte S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The biodegradation of fluoranthene, a high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), was investigated in submerged culture using the wood decaying fungus isolated from forest locality in Gujarat, India. The basidiomycete fungal isolate was found to have an ability to grow on sabaroud dextrose agar containing 50 mgl(-1) of each naphthalene, anthracene, acenaphthene, benzo (a) anthracene, pyrene, flouranthene, carbazole, and biphenyl. The involvement of extracellular fungal peroxidases such as manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccase (Phenol oxidase) in the degradation of fluoranthene was studied. On the eighth day of incubation 54.09% of 70 mg l(-1) fluoranthene was removed. There after no PAHs removal was observed till the 20th day of the incubation period. The isolate was identified as Pleurotus ostreatus by 18S rRNA, 5.8S rRNA, and partial 28S rRNA gene sequencing. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time Pleurotus ostreatus have been reported to degrade such a high concentration of fluoranthene within much lower time period of incubation. Depletion in the residual fluoranthene in the culture medium was determined by HPLC. Attempts were made to identify the degradation product in the culture medium with the help of FT-IR, NMR, and HPTLC analysis. In the present study positive correlation between fluoranthene degradation and the ligninolytic enzyme (MnP and laccase) production is observed, thus this isolate can play an effective role for bioremediation of PAHs contaminated sites.</em></small><br>[ID: 18574565]"

Banuett F, Quintanilla RH Jr, Reynaga-Peña CG<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ustilago maydis, a Basidiomycete fungus that infects maize, exhibits two basic morphologies, a yeast-like and a filamentous form. The yeast-like cell is elongated, divides by budding, and the bud grows by tip extension. The filamentous form divides at the apical cell and grows by tip extension. The repertoire of morphologies is increased during interaction with its host, suggesting that plant signals play an important role in generation of additional morphologies. We have used Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe genes known to play a role in cell polarity and morphogenesis, and in the cytoskeleton as probes to survey the U. maydis genome. We have found that most of the yeast machinery is conserved in U. maydis, albeit the degree of similarity varies from strong to weak. The U. maydis genome contains the machinery for recognition and interpretation of the budding yeast axial and bipolar landmarks; however, genes coding for some of the landmark proteins are absent. Genes coding for cell polarity establishment, exocytosis, actin and microtubule organization, microtubule plus-end associated proteins, kinesins, and myosins are also present. Genes not present in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe include a homolog of mammalian Rac, a hybrid myosin-chitin synthase, and several kinesins that exhibit more similarity to their mammalian counterparts. We also used the U. maydis genes identified in this analysis to search other fungal and other eukaryotic genomes to identify the closest homologs. In most cases, not surprisingly, the closest homolog is among filamentous fungi, not the yeasts, and in some cases it is among mammals.</em></small><br>[ID: 18582586]"

James TY, Stenlid J, Olson A, Johannesson H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Many fungi have heterokaryotic life stages in which genetically different nuclei inhabit the same cell. In basidiomycetes, the heterokaryon is the product of mating and represents a genomic union very similar to a diploid thallus, yet the maintenance of unfused nuclei suggests a more complex association of the two genomes relative to diploidy. In species with variable numbers of nuclei per heterokaryotic cell, nuclear ratios within a mycelium may possibly become imbalanced (differ from 1:1) due to nuclear competition. In this study, heterokaryons of the basidiomycete Heterobasidion parviporum were examined to determine the effects of genotype and environment on nuclear ratios within vegetative mycelia. The data reveal that nuclear ratios are frequently imbalanced, generally stable over time, and genetically determined. The nuclear ratios were affected by environment, but the observed nuclear ratios did not follow the expectations of strong selection acting on a population of nuclei. Instead, these ratios were largely driven by genetic effects and epigenetic effects. Finally, the data suggest that nuclear ratio imbalance also affects both gene transcription and growth rate, implying that heterokaryotic basidiomycetes are not functionally equivalent to diploid individuals and have a higher potential for genotypic and phenotypic variation.</em></small><br>[ID: 18637961]"

Scheuer C, Bauer R, Lutz M, Stabentheiner E, Mel'nik VA, Grube M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Bartheletia paradoxa, a basidiomycete growing on fallen leaves of Ginkgo biloba, is redescribed. In autumn a rapidly developing anamorph is formed on freshly fallen leaves and subsequently a teleomorph with hemispherical pustules of thick-walled resting spores (teliospores) that germinate after a resting period of one year with stipitate, longitudinally septate, statismosporic phragmobasidia. The basidia produce several basidiospores on each sporogenous locus. Inoculation experiments and observations in the field suggest that the basidiospores infect the freshly fallen leaves of G. biloba so that the life cycle is completed. The extraordinarily rapid development has also been confirmed in cultures on agar media and in inoculation experiments. Inoculation experiments also indicate that the fungus is specific to G. biloba. The septa of the hyphae have no central pores, but multiple plasmodesma-like perforations. The basidiospores and conidia are uninucleate, but an assessment of the karyology is still pending. A molecular phylogenetic hypothesis based on nuSSU rDNA sequences suggests that the fungus belongs to the Agaricomycotina, clustering in an unresolved position at the basal branching of the group. The family Bartheletiaceae fam. nov. is proposed to accommodate Bartheletia paradoxa in the Agaricomycotina.

Here we characterize in the phytopathogenic basidiomycete Ustilago maydis, the Spa2 protein, a well-known component of polarisome, firstly described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. U. maydis display a dimorphic switch between budding growth of hapoid cells and filamentous growth of the dikaryon. During yeast growth, a GFP-tagged Spa2 protein localized to distinct growth sites in a cell cycle-specific manner, while during hyphal growth is persistently located to hyphal tips. Deletion of spa2 gene produces rounder budding cells and thicker filaments than wild-type cells, suggesting a role of Spa2 for the determination of the growth area in U. maydis. We also address the connections between Spa2 and the actin- and microtubule-cytoskeleton. We found that the absence of Spa2 does not affect cytoskeleton organization and strikingly, interference with actin filament or microtubule formation does not affect the polar localization of Spa2. In contrast, defects in the small GTPase Rac1 seems to affect the ability of Spa2 to locate to precise sites at the tip cell.

Though they often share most recent common ancestors with wood-rotting fungi, it is unclear to what extent EM fungi retain the ability to express enzymes that break down woody substrates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the dominant EM fungus in a pure pine system retains the ability to produce enzymes that break down woody substrates in a natural setting, and that this ability is inducible by reduction of host photosynthetic potential via partial defoliation. To achieve this, pines in replicate blocks were defoliated 50% by needle removal, and enzyme activities were measured in individual EM root tips that had been treated with antibiotics to prevent possible bacterial activity. Results indicate that the dominant EM fungal species (Suillus granulatus) expressed all enzymes tested (endocellulase D: -glucosidase, laccase, manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, phosphatase and protease), and that activities of these enzymes increased significantly (P < 0.001) in response to defoliation. Thus, this EM fungus (one of the more specialized mutualists of pine) has the potential to play a significant role in C, N and P cycling in this forested ecosystem. Therefore, many above-ground factors that reduce photosynthetic potential or divert fixed C from roots may have wide-reaching ecosystem effects.</em></small><br>[ID: 18679722]"

Gutiérrez M, Rojas LA, Mancilla-Villalobos R, Seelenfreund D, Vicuña R, Lobos S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In this work, we explore the use of the unbiased cDNA-AFLP strategy to identify genes involved in Mn(2+) homeostasis in Ceriporiopsis subvermispora. In this ligninolytic white-rot fungus, whose genome has not yet been sequenced, three Mn peroxidase genes responding to Mn(2+) have been characterized. Using cDNA-AFLP to identify transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), a total of 37 differentially expressed cDNA fragments were identified by comparing band intensities among cDNA-AFLP patterns obtained from mycelia from cultures supplemented with different concentrations of Mn(2+). Of 21 differentially expressed TDFs, nine were classified as upregulated, five as downregulated and seven as unregulated. Of these, six upregulated and two downregulated TDFs were selected for further characterization. The expected TDFs for the known Mn peroxidases were not isolated, but several genes encoding proteins related to protein sorting, storage and excretion of excess Mn(2+) were identified. Transcripts induced under Mn(2+) supplementation exhibited homologies to the elongation factor eEF3, a HDEL sequence binding protein and the ARD1 subunit of the N-acetyltransferase complex, among others. Overall, the results obtained in this study suggest a complex picture of Mn(2+) homeostasis and provide the possibility to search for common regulatory elements in the promoters of the novel putatively identified genes.</em></small><br>[ID: 18726100]"

For map construction, 294 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were employed to identify and assay loci that segregated in backcross configuration. Using SNP, RAPD and SSR sequences, the L. bicolor whole-genome sequence (WGS) assemblies were aligned onto the linkage groups. A total of 37.36 Mbp of the assembled sequences was aligned to 13 linkage groups. Most mapped genetic markers used in alignment were colinear with the sequence assemblies, indicating that both the genetic map and sequence assemblies achieved high fidelity. The resulting matrix of recombination rates between all pairs of loci was used to construct an integrated linkage map using JoinMap. The final map consisted of 13 linkage groups spanning 812 centiMorgans (cM) at an average distance of 2.76 cM between markers (range 1.9-17 cM).

The DNA is a circular molecule of 109,103 base pairs, with 31.9% GC, and is the largest sequenced so far. This size is due essentially to the presence of numerous non-conserved hypothetical ORFs. It contains the 14 genes coding for proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation, the two rRNA genes, one ORF coding for a ribosomal protein (rps3), and a set of 26 tRNA genes that recognize codons for all amino acids. Seven homing endonucleases are located inside introns. Except atp8, all conserved known genes are in the same orientation. Phylogenetic analysis based on the cox genes agrees with the commonly accepted fungal taxonomy. An uncommon feature of this mitochondrial genome is the presence of a region that contains a set of four, relatively small, nested, inverted repeats enclosing two genes coding for polymerases with an invertron-type structure and three conserved hypothetical genes interpreted as the stable integration of a mitochondrial linear plasmid.

Shary S, Kapich AN, Panisko EA, Magnuson JK, Cullen D, Hammel KE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungal lignin-degrading systems likely include membrane-associated proteins that participate in diverse processes such as uptake and oxidation of lignin fragments, production of ligninolytic secondary metabolites, and defense of the mycelium against ligninolytic oxidants. Little is known about the nature or regulation of these membrane-associated components. We grew the white rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium on cellulose or glucose as the carbon source and monitored the mineralization of a (14)C-labeled synthetic lignin by these cultures to assess their ligninolytic competence. The results showed that the cellulose-grown cultures were ligninolytic, whereas the glucose-grown ones were not. We isolated microsomal membrane fractions from both types of culture and analyzed tryptic digests of their proteins by shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Comparison of the results against the predicted P. chrysosporium proteome showed that a catalase (Joint Genome Institute P. chrysosporium protein identification number [I.D.] 124398), an alcohol oxidase (126879), two transporters (137220 and 132234), and two cytochrome P450s (5011 and 8912) were upregulated under ligninolytic conditions. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays showed that RNA transcripts encoding all of these proteins were also more abundant in ligninolytic cultures. Catalase 124398, alcohol oxidase 126879, and transporter 137220 were found in a proteomic analysis of partially purified plasma membranes from ligninolytic P. chrysosporium and are therefore most likely associated with the outer envelope of the fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 18849459]"

No information is currently available concerning levels of genetic diversity and population structure for this pathogen in Brazil. A total of 232 isolates of R. solani AG1 IA were collected from five soybean fields in the most important soybean production areas in central-western, northern, and northeastern Brazil. These isolates were genotyped using 10 microsatellite loci. Most of the multilocus genotypes (MLGTs) were site-specific, with few MLGTs shared among populations. Significant population subdivision was evident. High levels of admixture were observed for populations from Mato Grosso and Tocantins. After removing admixed genotypes, three out of five field populations (Maranhao, Mato Grosso, and Tocantins), were in Hardy-Weinberg (HW) equilibrium, consistent with sexual recombination. HW and gametic disequilibrium were found for the remaining soybean-infecting populations. The findings of low genotypic diversity, departures from HW equilibrium, gametic disequilibrium, and high degree of population subdivision in these R. solani AG-1 IA populations from Brazil are consistent with predominantly asexual reproduction, short-distance dispersal of vegetative propagules (mycelium or sclerotia), and limited long-distance dispersal, possibly via contaminated seed. None of the soybean-infecting populations showed a reduction in population size (bottleneck effect). We detected asymmetric historical migration among the soybean-infecting populations, which could explain the observed levels of subdivision.</em></small><br>[ID: 18943212]"

Guest D, Keane P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>ABSTRACT The basidiomycete Oncobasidium theobromae was identified as the cause of a devastating disease of cacao named vascular-streak dieback (VSD) in Papua New Guinea in the 1960s. VSD now causes losses among cacao seedlings and kills branches in mature cacao trees throughout Southeast Asia and parts of Melanesia. The characteristic symptoms include a green-spotted chlorosis and fall of leaves beginning on the second or third flush behind the stem apex, raised lenticels, and darkening of vascular traces at the leaf scars and infected xylem. Eventually complete defoliation occurs and, if the fungus spreads to the trunk, the tree will die. O. theobromae is a highly specialized, near-obligate parasite of cocoa. It is a windborne, leaf-penetrating, vascular pathogen, and may have evolved as an endophyte on an as yet unidentified indigenous host. The rate of disease spread on cocoa is limited because basidiocarps develop only on fresh leaf scars during wet weather, and basidiospores remain viable for a few hours on the night they are shed. Consequently, very few new infections occur beyond 80-m from diseased trees. Transmission of the disease through seed or infected cuttings has not been demonstrated. Strict quarantine measures applied to the movement of intact plants are crucial in reducing spread of the disease. Integrated management, including the planting of less susceptible genotypes, nursery construction and management, canopy pruning and shade management, provides effective control.</em></small><br>[ID: 18943729]"

Trichoderma stromaticum is a mycoparasite of the witches'-broom pathogen of cacao that is currently being applied in the field to manage the disease in Bahia State, Brazil. In this work, molecular and traditional methods were used to study the genetic and biological diversity of this mycoparasite. Ninety-one isolates, mostly collected from farms not sprayed with the fungus, were analyzed by amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), which showed that two genetic groups (I and II) of T. stromaticum occur in Bahia State. This classification of T. stromaticum into two distinct AFLP groups was also in agreement with several other characteristics, including growth on agar media at different temperatures and sporulation on infected stem segments (broom pieces) and rice grains. Group II favors higher temperatures compared with group I. The genetic and biological differences of the isolates, however, were not evident in field experiments, where sporulation was evaluated on the surface of brooms under natural conditions. Our results show that there is considerable genetic and biological diversity within T. stromaticum in Bahia and other cacao-growing regions of South America that are affected by the witches'-broom disease. This diversity could be explored in the development of efficient biological control agents against the disease. Factors that may affect the application and performance of this biocontrol agent in the field, such as sporulation on rice substrate and on the brooms and growth at various temperatures, are discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 18944205]"

Garbelotto M, Cobb FW, Bruns TD, Otrosina WJ, Popenuck T, Slaughter G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>ABSTRACT The structure of Heterobasidion annosum populations was studied in 15 mixed-conifer sites in central and northern California. Study sites displayed mortality of white fir trees in enlarging discrete patches (mortality centers). At each site, fungal genotypes were defined by somatic compatibility tests. In two sites, further genetic and molecular analyses were performed on field genotypes and on homokaryons obtained by dedikaryotization of field heterokaryons. Isolates were found to be colonizing mostly the roots and the bole sapwood of white fir trees, and no significant infections of other tree species were observed. Each mortality center was characterized by the presence of several fungal genotypes, all belonging to the S intersterility group. Both homokaryotic and heterokaryotic strains were present in all sites. Multiple genotypes were retrieved in individual trees or stumps. Out of 228 fungal genotypes, 86% were found only within a single tree or stump, while 14% had spread to adjacent trees. The two largest genotypes had diameters of 9 and 10 m, and had colonized five and nine trees, stumps, or both, respectively. The maximum distance between two adjacent trees colonized by the same genotype was 6 m, and a highly significant correlation was found between tree diameter and distance of fungal \"vegetative\" spread. The largest clones were found in areas characterized by high tree and stump densities, and secondary spread of the fungus was more significant in denser stands. In most cases, original infection courts of existing genotypes could be traced to standing trees and not to stumps. The genetic analysis performed in two mortality centers revealed that most local genotypes had different mating alleles, and thus originated from unrelated basidiospores. In a few cases, the same mating allele was shared by two heterokaryons (n+n genome) or by a homokaryon (n genome) and a heterokaryon. Molecular analysis showed that nuclei bearing the same mating allele were identical, providing evidence that the two nuclei forming heterokaryons can act independently in the field and can be shared among isolates, presumably via di-mon mating or by separate matings of different portions of widespread homokaryons.</em></small><br>[ID: 18944689]"

The full-length cDNAs corresponding to these two ESTs complemented a yeast phosphate transport mutant (Deltapho84). Measurements of (33)P-phosphate influx into yeast expressing either cDNA demonstrated that the encoded proteins, named HcPT1 and HcPT2, were able to mediate Pi:H(+) symport with different affinities for Pi (K(m) values of 55 and 4 mum, respectively). Real-time RT-PCR showed that Pi starvation increased the levels of HcPT1 transcripts in H. cylindrosporum hyphae grown in pure culture. Transcript levels of HcPT2 were less dependent on Pi availability. The two transporters were expressed in H. cylindrosporum associated with its natural host plant, Pinus pinaster, grown under low or high P conditions. The presence of ectomycorrhizae increased net Pi uptake rates into intact Pinus pinaster roots at low or high soil P levels.

Zhuang X, Tlalka M, Davies DS, Allaway WG, Watkinson SC, Ashford AE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Growth and organelle morphology in the wood rotting basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete velutina were examined in Petri dishes, on agar-coated slides, and in submerged cultures, using DIC, fluorescence and four-dimensional (4-D; x,y,z,t) confocal microscopy, with several fluorescent probes. Phanerochaete is ideal for this work because of its fast growth, robustness, and use in a wide range of other studies. The probe carboxy-DFFDA, widely used for labelling vacuoles, has no effect either on hyphal tip extension or colony growth at the concentrations usually applied in labelling experiments. Carboxy-DFFDA labels the vacuoles and these form a tubular reticulum in hyphal tip cells. The probe also labels extremely small vesicles (punctate fluorescence) in the apex of tip cells, the Spitzenkörper, and short tubules that undergo sequences of characteristic movements and transformations to produce various morphologies, including ring-like structures. Their location and behaviour suggest that they are a distinct group of structures, possibly a subset of vacuoles, but as yet to be fully identified. Regular incursions of tubules extending from these structures and from the vacuolar reticulum into the apical dome indicate the potential for delivery of material to the apex via tubules as well as vesicles. Such structures are potential candidates for delivering chitin synthases to the apex. Spitzenkörper behaviour has been followed as hyphal tips with linear growth encounter obstacle hyphae and, as the hydrolysis product of carboxy-DFFDA only accumulates in membrane-enclosed compartments, it can be inferred that the labelled structures represent the Spitzenkörper vesicle cloud. Mitochondria also form a reticular continuum of branched tubules in growing hyphal tips, and dual localisation with DiOC6(3) and CMAC allows this to be distinguished from the vacuolar reticulum. Like vacuolar tubules, mitochondrial tubules also span the septa, indicating that they may also be a conduit for intercellular transport.</em></small><br>[ID: 19114102]"

Pérez G, Pangilinan J, Pisabarro AG, Ramírez L<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Telomeres are structural and functional chromosome regions that are essential for the cell cycle to proceed normally. They are, however, difficult to map genetically and to identify in genome-wide sequence programs because of their structure and repetitive nature. We studied the telomeric and subtelomeric organization in the basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus using a combination of molecular and bioinformatics tools that permitted us to determine 19 out of the 22 telomeres expected in this fungus. The telomeric repeating unit in P. ostreatus is TTAGGG, and the numbers of repetitions of this unit range between 25 and 150. The mapping of the telomere restriction fragments to linkage groups 6 and 7 revealed polymorphisms compatible with those observed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis separation of the corresponding chromosomes. The subtelomeric regions in Pleurotus contain genes similar to those described in other eukaryotic systems. The presence of a cluster of laccase genes in chromosome 6 and a bipartite structure containing a Het-related protein and an alcohol dehydrogenase are especially relevant; this bipartite structure is characteristic of the Pezizomycotina fungi Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus terreus. As far as we know, this is the first report describing the presence of such structures in basidiomycetes and the location of a laccase gene cluster in the subtelomeric region, where, among others, species-specific genes allowing the organism to adapt rapidly to the environment usually map.</em></small><br>[ID: 19114509]"

Martin F, Selosse MA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The first genomic sequence for a representative of symbiotic fungi, the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor, has been published. The unravelling of this genome provides tantalizing hints about differences between this symbiotic fungus and its saprotrophic and pathogenic relatives. An expansion of several multigene families occurred in L. bicolor, suggesting that adaptation to symbiosis proceeded by gene duplication. Within lineage-specific genes those coding for symbiosis-regulated secreted proteins showed an up-regulated expression in ectomycorrhizas. L. bicolor is lacking enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall components (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and pectates), preventing the symbiont from degrading host cells. By contrast, L. bicolor possesses expanded multigene families associated with hydrolysis of bacterial and microfauna polysaccharides and proteins. The genome analysis revealed the dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle of the mycorrhizal fungus that enables it to grow within both soil and living plant roots. The next stages will involve finer-scale investigation of gene networks to reveal the details of the general patterns now uncovered at the genomic level. The acceptance of L. bicolor as a model organism for symbiosis genetics will, however, depend strongly on the availability of additional genetic, genomic and molecular biological resources, such as gene inactivation procedures.</em></small><br>[ID: 19138220]"

Lee JW, Park JY, Kwon M, Choi IG<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A thermostable extracellular xylanase was purified and characterized from brown-rot basidiomycete Laetiporus sulphureus, cultivated on biologically pretreated Pinus densiflora biomass. After three consecutive purification steps using DEAE, Mono Q, and Superdex 75 columns, the xylanase specific activity was found to be 72.4 U/mg, nine fold higher than that of the crude culture solution, purity was 96%, and the molecular mass determined to be 69.3 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature for xylanase activity were 3.0 and 80 degrees C, respectively. Although activity of xylanase was highest at 80 degrees C, it showed highest thermostability at 60 degrees C, retaining approximately 97% of its relative activity following incubation for 4 h. In the presence of 5 mM solution of CaCl2, the relative xylanase activity increased by 35.9%; however, it decreased significantly in the presence of 10 mM solution of Cu2+. Among the xylan-based substrates tested, purified L. sulphureus xylanase showed the highest activity on beechwood xylan. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) experiments revealed that purified L. sulphureus xylanase is an endoxylanase that hydrolyzes xylotriose, xylotetraose, and xylopentaose but not xylobiose.</em></small><br>[ID: 19147106]"

Medical therapy with local broad-spectrum antibiotic and fluconazole was instituted. After 1 week of treatment, the improvement was deemed unsatisfactory. Therefore, a lamellar keratectomy and conjunctival pedicle flap were performed. After surgery, the cornea healed uneventfully. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of keratomycosis. The fungus could not be grown in culture and a precise etiological diagnosis could only be obtained with genetic identification of the fungus. A PCR technique was used to amplify the fungal genome from the cornea. Hormographiella aspergillata, the asexual reproductive form of the basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea, was identified. As advised in human medicine, we encourage the use of this molecular technique to obtain an early species diagnosis, allowing targeted medical therapy.</em></small><br>[ID: 19152597]"

Visser AA, Ros VI, De Beer ZW, Debets AJ, Hartog E, Kuyper TW, Laessøe T, Slippers B, Aanen DK<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungus-growing termites live in obligate mutualistic symbiosis with species of the basidiomycete genus Termitomyces, which are cultivated on a substrate of dead plant material. When the termite colony dies, or when nest material is incubated without termites in the laboratory, fruiting bodies of the ascomycete genus Xylaria appear and rapidly cover the fungus garden. This raises the question whether certain Xylaria species are specialised in occupying termite nests or whether they are just occasional visitors. We tested Xylaria specificity at four levels: (1) fungus-growing termites, (2) termite genera, (3) termite species, and (4) colonies. In South Africa, 108 colonies of eight termite species from three termite genera were sampled for Xylaria. Xylaria was isolated from 69% of the sampled nests and from 57% of the incubated fungus comb samples, confirming high prevalence. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region revealed 16 operational taxonomic units of Xylaria, indicating high levels of Xylaria species richness. Not much of this variation was explained by termite genus, species, or colony; thus, at level 2-4 the specificity is low. Analysis of the large subunit rDNA region, showed that all termite-associated Xylaria belong to a single clade, together with only three of the 26 non-termite-associated strains. Termite-associated Xylaria thus show specificity for fungus-growing termites (level 1). We did not find evidence for geographic or temporal structuring in these Xylaria phylogenies. Based on our results, we conclude that termite-associated Xylaria are specific for fungus-growing termites, without having specificity for lower taxonomic levels.</em></small><br>[ID: 19161474]"

Takakura Y, Tsunashima M, Suzuki J, Usami S, Kakuta Y, Okino N, Ito M, Yamamoto T<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Novel biotin-binding proteins, referred to herein as tamavidin 1 and tamavidin 2, were found in a basidiomycete fungus, Pleurotus cornucopiae, known as the Tamogitake mushroom. These are the first avidin-like proteins to be discovered in organisms other than birds and bacteria. Tamavidin 1 and tamavidin 2 have amino acid sequences with 31% and 36% identity, respectively, to avidin, and 47% and 48% identity, respectively, to streptavidin. Unlike any other biotin-binding proteins, tamavidin 1 and tamavidin 2 are expressed as soluble proteins at a high level in Escherichia coli. Recombinant tamavidin 2 was purified as a tetrameric protein in a single step by 2-iminobiotin affinity chromatography, with a yield of 5 mg per 100 mL culture of E. coli. The kinetic parameters measured by a BIAcore biosensor indicated that recombinant tamavidin 2 binds biotin with high affinity, in a similar manner to binding by avidin and streptavidin. The overall crystal structure of recombinant tamavidin 2 is similar to that of avidin and streptavidin. However, recombinant tamavidin 2 is immunologically distinct from avidin and streptavidin. Tamavidin 2 and streptavidin are very similar in terms of the arrangement of the residues interacting with biotin, but different with regard to the number of hydrogen bonds to biotin carboxylate. Recombinant tamavidin 2 is more stable than avidin and streptavidin at high temperature, and nonspecific binding to DNA and human serum by recombinant tamavidin 2 is lower than that for avidin. These findings highlight tamavidin 2 as a probable powerful tool, in addition to avidin and streptavidin, in numerous applications of biotin-binding proteins.</em></small><br>[ID: 19187241]"

Doehlemann G, van der Linde K, Assmann D, Schwammbach D, Hof A, Mohanty A, Jackson D, Kahmann R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Ustilago maydis causes smut disease in maize. Colonization of the host plant is initiated by direct penetration of cuticle and cell wall of maize epidermis cells. The invading hyphae are surrounded by the plant plasma membrane and proliferate within the plant tissue. We identified a novel secreted protein, termed Pep1, that is essential for penetration. Disruption mutants of pep1 are not affected in saprophytic growth and develop normal infection structures. However, Deltapep1 mutants arrest during penetration of the epidermal cell and elicit a strong plant defense response. Using Affymetrix maize arrays, we identified 116 plant genes which are differentially regulated in Deltapep1 compared to wild type infections. Most of these genes are related to plant defense. By in vivo immunolocalization, live-cell imaging and plasmolysis approaches, we detected Pep1 in the apoplastic space as well as its accumulation at sites of cell-to-cell passages. Site-directed mutagenesis identified two of the four cysteine residues in Pep1 as essential for function, suggesting that the formation of disulfide bridges is crucial for proper protein folding. The barley covered smut fungus Ustilago hordei contains an ortholog of pep1 which is needed for penetration of barley and which is able to complement the U. maydis Deltapep1 mutant. Based on these results, we conclude that Pep1 has a conserved function essential for establishing compatibility that is not restricted to the U. maydis / maize interaction.</em></small><br>[ID: 19197359]"

When inoculated on the nonhost barley P. pachyrhizi caused only very small necrotic spots, typical for an incompatible interaction, which involves a hypersensitive cell death reaction. A microscopic inspection of the interaction of barley with P. pachyrhizi revealed that the fungus germinated on barley and formed functional appressoria on epidermal cells. The fungus attempted to directly penetrate through periclinal cell walls but often failed, arrested in plant cell wall appositions that stained positively for callose. Penetration resistance depends on intact ROR1(REQUIRED FOR mlo-SPECIFIED RESISTANCE 1) and ROR2 genes of barley. If the fungus succeeded in penetration, epidermal cell death took place. Dead epidermal cells did not generally restrict fungal development but allowed for mesophyll invasion, which was followed by mesophyll cell death and fungal arrest. Transient or stable over expression of the barley cell death suppressor BAX inhibitor-1 reduced both epidermal cell death and fungal penetration success. Data suggest that P. pachyrhizi provokes a programmed cell death facilitating fungal entry into epidermal cells of barley.</em></small><br>[ID: 19203273]"

Among the four species P. sajor caju and R. oryzae were the most effective in the biodegradation of organic compounds present in the effluent, being responsible for the reduction of relative absorbance (25-46% at 250 nm and 72-74% at 465 nm) and of chemical oxygen demand levels (74 to 81%) after 10 days of incubation. Laccase (Lac), lignin (Lip) and manganese peroxidases (MnP) expression varied among fungal species, where Lac and LiP activities were correlated with the degradation of organic compounds in the effluent treated with P. sajor caju. The first two axes of a principal component analysis explained 88.9% of the total variation among sub-samples treated with the four fungus species, after different incubation periods.

Pérez-Martín J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Chk1 is a protein kinase that acts as a key signal transducer within the complex network responsible of the cellular response to different DNA damages. It is a conserved element along the eukaryotic kingdom, together with a second checkpoint kinase, called Chk2/Rad53. In fact, all organisms studied so far carried at least one copy of each kind of checkpoint kinase. Since the relative contribution to the DNA-damage response of each type of kinase varies from one organism to other, the current view about the roles of Chk1 and Chk2/Rad53 during DNA-damage response is one of mutual complementation and intimate cooperation. However, in this work it is reported that Ustilago maydis - a phytopathogenic fungus exhibiting extreme resistance to UV and ionizing radiation - have a single kinase belonging to the Chk1 family but strikingly no kinases related to Chk2/Rad53 family are apparent. The U. maydis Chk1 kinase is able to respond to different classes of DNA damages and its activity is required for the cellular adaptation to such damages. As other described components of the Chk1 family of kinases, U. maydis Chk1 is phosphorylated and translocated to nucleus in response to DNA-damage signals. Interestingly subtle differences in this response depending on the kind of DNA damage are apparent, suggesting that in U. maydis the sole Chk1 kinase recapitulates the roles that in other organisms are shared by Chk1 and the Chk2/Rad53 family of protein kinases.</em></small><br>[ID: 19269260]"

Harreither W, Sygmund C, Dünhofen E, Vicuña R, Haltrich D, Ludwig R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), an extracellular flavocytochrome produced by several wood-degrading fungi, was detected in cultures of the selective delignifier Ceriporiopsis subvermispora when grown on a cellulose- and yeast extract-based liquid medium. CDH amounted to up to 2.5% of total extracellular protein during latter phases of the cultivation and thus suggested an important function for the fungus under the given conditions. The enzyme was purified 44-fold to apparent homogeneity. It was found to be present in two glycoforms of 98 kDa and 87 kDa with carbohydrate contents of 16 and 4%, respectively. The isoelectric point of both glycoforms is around 3.0, differing by 0.1 units, which is the most acidic value so far reported for a CDH. By using degenerated primers of known CDH sequences, one cdh gene was found in the genomic DNA, cloned, and sequenced. Alignment of the 774-amino-acid protein sequence revealed a high similarity to CDH from other white rot fungi. One notable difference was found in the longer interdomain peptide linker, which might affect the interdomain electron transfer at higher temperatures. The preferred substrate of C. subvermispora CDH is cellobiose, while glucose conversion is strongly discriminated by a 155,000-fold-lower catalytic efficiency. This is a typical feature of a basidiomycete CDH, as are the acidic pH optima for all tested electron acceptors in the range from 2.5 to 4.5.</em></small><br>[ID: 19270118]"

Amoroso A, Mancilla RA, González B, Vicuña R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The biodegradation of lignin is a highly oxidative process in which various oxidases and peroxidases play a major role. During lignin decay, the generation of aromatic compounds and reactive oxygen species leads to oxidative stress. In this work, the effect of the oxidative compounds H(2)O(2) and hydroquinone in the ligninolytic fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora was studied, both at the ultrastructural and at the transcriptional level. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of microvesicles and extensive cytoplasm degeneration after incubation with hydroquinone, but not with H(2)O(2). Studies of the intracellular redox state of the fungus showed that hydroquinone causes a transient decrease in the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio and an increase in the glutathione-S-transferase mRNA levels. These results suggest that hydroquinone produces oxidative stress in this microorganism. On the other hand, it was observed that hydroquinone, but not H(2)O(2), affects Mn-dependent peroxide and laccase transcripts levels. We propose that the mechanism by which the fungus reacts against oxidative stress contributes to its selectivity toward lignin during wood decay.</em></small><br>[ID: 19341391]"

Hietala AM, Nagy NE, Steffenrem A, Kvaalen H, Fossdal CG, Solheim H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In Norway spruce, a fungistatic reaction zone with a high pH and enrichment of phenolics is formed in the sapwood facing heartwood colonized by the white-rot fungus Heterobasidion parviporum. Fungal penetration of the reaction zone eventually results in expansion of this xylem defense. To obtain information about mechanisms operating upon heartwood and reaction zone colonization by the pathogen, hyphal growth and wood degradation were investigated using real-time PCR, microscopy, and comparative wood density analysis of naturally colonized trees with extensive stem decay. The hyphae associated with delignified wood at stump level were devoid of any extracellular matrix, whereas incipient decay at the top of decay columns was characterized by a carbohydrate-rich hyphal sheath attaching hyphae to tracheid walls. The amount of pathogen DNA peaked in aniline wood, a narrow darkened tissue at the colony border apparently representing a compromised region of the reaction zone. Vigorous production of pathogen conidiophores occurred in this region. Colonization of aniline wood was characterized by hyphal growth within polyphenolic lumen deposits in tracheids and rays, and the hyphae were fully encased in a carbohydrate-rich extracellular matrix. Together, these data indicate that the interaction of the fungus with the reaction zone involves a local concentration of fungal biomass that forms an efficient translocation channel for nutrients. Finally, the enhanced production of the hyphal sheath may be instrumental in lateral expansion of the decay column beyond the reaction zone boundary.</em></small><br>[ID: 19376909]"

Sixty-three genes of the major pathways were annotated and validated by the detection of the corresponding transcripts. Seventy-one per cent belonged to multigene families of up to five members. In the mycelium of L. bicolor, 19 different fatty acids were detected, including at low concentrations palmitvaccenic acid (16:1(11Z)), which is known to be a marker for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The pathways of fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation in L. bicolor were reconstructed using lipid composition, gene annotation and transcriptional analysis. Annotation results indicated that saturated fatty acids were degraded in mitochondria, whereas degradation of modified fatty acids was confined to peroxisomes. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) was the second largest protein annotated in L. bicolor. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that L. bicolor, Ustilago maydis and Coprinopsis cinerea have a vertebrate-like type I FAS encoded as a single protein, whereas in other basidiomycetes, including the human pathogenic basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, and in most ascomycetes FAS is composed of the two structurally distinct subunits α and β.</em></small><br>[ID: 19383096]"

Zhang C, Yin L, Dai S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>To investigate the diversity of root endophytes in Rhododendron fortunei, fungal strains were isolated from the hair roots of plants from four habitats in subtropical forests of China. In total, 220 slow-growing fungal isolates were isolated from the hair roots of R. fortunei. The isolates were initially grouped into 17 types based on the results of internal transcribed spacer-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP) analysis. ITS sequences were obtained for representative isolates from each RFLP type and compared phylogenetically with known sequences of ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes and selected ascomycetes or basidiomycetes. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences in GenBank, 15 RFLP types were confirmed as ascomycetes, and two as basidiomycetes; nine of these were shown to be ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes in experimental cultures. The only common endophytes of R. fortunei were identified as Oidiodendron maius at four sites, although the isolation frequency (3-65%) differed sharply according to habitat. Phialocephala fortinii strains were isolated most abundantly from two habitats which related to the more acidic soil and pine mixed forests. A number of less common mycorrhizal RFLP types were isolated from R. fortunei at three, two, or one of the sites. Most of these appeared to have strong affinities for some unidentified root endophytes from Ericaceae hosts in Australian forests. We concluded that the endophyte population isolated from R. fortunei is composed mainly of ascomycete, as well as a few basidiomycete strains. In addition, one basidiomycete strain was confirmed as a putative ericoid mycorrhizal fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 19396474]"

Yoneda A, Doering TL<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycete that causes deadly infections in the immunocompromised. We previously generated a secretion mutant in this fungus by introducing a mutation in the SAV1 gene, which encodes a homolog of the Sec4/Rab8 subfamily GTPases. Under restrictive conditions there are two notable morphological changes in the sav1 mutant: accumulation of post-Golgi vesicles and the appearance of an unusual organelle, which we term the sav1 body (SB). The SB is an electron-transparent structure 0.2-1microm in diameter, with vesicles or other membranous structures associated with the perimeter. Surprisingly, the SB was heavily labeled with anti-glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) antibodies, suggesting that it contains a secreted capsule component, GXM. A structure similar to the SB, also labeled by anti-GXM antibodies, was induced in wild type cells treated with the vacuolar-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A(1). Bafilomycin A(1) and other agents that increase intraluminal pH also inhibited capsule polysaccharide shedding and capsule growth. These studies highlight an unusual organelle observed in C. neoformans with a potential role in polysaccharide synthesis, and a link between luminal pH and GXM biosynthesis.</em></small><br>[ID: 19450701]"

Hedh J, Johansson T, Tunlid A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ectomycorrhizal fungi are known to vary in host range. Some fungi can enter into symbiosis with multiple plant species, while others have restricted host ranges. The aim of this study was to examine variation in host specificity among strains from the basidiomycete Paxillus involutus s. lat. Recent studies have shown that this fungus consists of at least four genetically isolated lineages, phylogenetic species (PS) I (which corresponds to the morphological species Paxillus obscurosporus), PS II (P. involutus s. str.), PS III (Paxillus validus), and PS IV (not yet supported by any reference material). Thirty-five Paxillus strains of PS I to IV were examined in microcosms for their capacity to infect birch (Betula pendula) and spruce (Picea abies). Seventeen strains were compatible and formed mycorrhizae with both tree species. Seven strains were incompatible with both birch and spruce. The gene content in three pairs of incompatible and compatible strains PS I, II, and III were compared using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridizations. Of 4,113 P. involutus gene representatives analyzed, 390 varied in copy numbers in at least one of the three pairwise comparisons. Only three reporters showed significant changes in all three pairwise comparisons, and none of these were changed in a similar way in three comparisons. Our data indicate that changes in host range have occurred frequently and independently among strains in P. obscurosporus, P. involutus s. str., and P. validus. No evidence was obtained demonstrating that these changes have been associated with the gain or loss of similar genes in these three species.</em></small><br>[ID: 19452174]"

Here, the Suicide Polymerase Endonuclease Restriction (SuPER) method was adapted for the first time to a fungal study to determine the entire fungal community of fungal combs and to test whether fungi other than the symbiotic cultivar interact with termite hosts. Our molecular analyses show that although active combs are dominated by Termitomyces fungi isolated with direct Polymerase Endonuclease Restriction - Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), they can also harbor some filamentous fungi and yeasts only revealed by SuPER PCR-DGGE. This is the first molecular evidence of the presence of non-Termitomyces species in active combs. However, because there is no evidence for a species-specific relationship between these fungi and termites, they are mere transient guests with no specialization in the symbiosis. It is however surprising to notice that termite-associated Xylaria strains were not isolated from active combs even though they are frequently retrieved when nests are abandoned by termites.

In this work, we line out the key conserved enzymes for beta-carotene biosynthesis encoded by the U. maydis genome and show that this biotrophic fungus accumulates beta-carotene. The amount of this pigment depended on culture pH and aeration but was not affected by light and was not increased by oxidative stress. Moreover, we identified the U. maydis gene, cco1, encoding a putative beta-carotene cleavage oxygenase. Heterologous overexpression and in vitro analyses of purified enzyme demonstrated that Cco1 catalyzes the symmetrical cleavage of beta-carotene to yield two molecules of retinal. Analyses of beta-carotene and retinal contents in U. maydiscco1 deletion and over-expression strains confirmed the enzymatic function of Cco1, and revealed that Cco1 determines the beta-carotene content. Our data indicate that carotenoid biosynthesis in U. maydis is carried out to provide retinal rather than to deliver protective pigments. The U. maydis genome also encodes three potential opsins, a family of photoactive proteins that use retinal as chromophore. Two opsin genes showed different light-regulated expression patterns, suggesting specialized roles in photobiology, while no mRNA was detected for the third opsin gene in the same experiments. However, deletion of the cco1 gene, which should abolish function of all the retinal-dependent opsins, did not affect growth, morphology or pathogenicity, suggesting that retinal and opsin proteins play no relevant role in U. maydis under the tested conditions.</em></small><br>[ID: 19584000]"

The protocol is based on the control of light intensity and photoperiod and permits the life cycle for this fungus to be completed in less than two weeks. The fruiting bodies produced by this method release fertile spores after 4-5 d of culture. Our results indicate that fruiting induction is solely dependent on the illumination regime and that it occurs long before the available nutrients are depleted in the culture.

In the long term (days), plants with P. indica-colonized roots responded to inoculation with the leaf-pathogenic powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei with a leaf apoplastic pH increase of about 2, while the leaf apoplast of noncolonized barley responded to B. graminis f. sp. hordei merely with a pH increase of 0.8. The strong apoplastic pH response is reminiscent of B. graminis f. sp. hordei-triggered pH shifts in resistance gene-mediated resistant barley leaves or upon treatment with a chemical resistance inducer. In contrast, the MAMP N-acetylchito-octaose did not induce resistance to B. graminis f. sp. hordei and did not trigger the primed apoplastic pH shift. We speculate that the primed pH increase is indicative of and supports the potentiated systemic response to B. graminis f. sp. hordei-induced by P. indica in barley.</em></small><br>[ID: 19656052]"

In this chapter, we explain in detail the two methods most commonly employed for C. cinereus, staining of intact gill segments and chromosome spreads, with an example of the application of each. We describe iron-hematoxylin staining of intact gill segments for the brightfield examination of meiotic progression, and the use of surface spreads and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to investigate meiotic chromosome pairing. Gill segments can alternatively be stained with DAPI for the determination of meiotic stage, or propidium iodide for the quantitation of nuclear DNA content, and the chromosome fixation and spreading techniques used for FISH are also suitable for immunolocalization studies of chromosomal proteins.</em></small><br>[ID: 19685322]"

Ott T, Fritz E, Polle A, Schützendübel A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The effect of different cadmium (Cd) concentrations (5, 50 and 500 microM) on growth, Cd accumulation and antioxidative systems was studied in Paxillus involutus, grown in liquid medium. Cd was rapidly accumulated by P. involutus and resulted in growth inhibition within 24 h. Antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), EC 1.15.1.1; catalase (CAT), EC 1.11.1.6; monodehydroascorbate radical reductase (MDAR), EC 1.6.5.4; dehydroascorbate reductase (DAR) glutathione reductase (GR), EC 1.8.1.7 and glutathione-dependent peroxidase (GPx), EC 1.11.1.9) were active in the investigated fungus. Furthermore, high concentrations of glutathione but no ascorbate were detected. Cd exposure resulted in a significant induction of SOD activity. However, activities of enzymes responsible for the detoxification of H2O2 showed no Cd-dependent increase or were only transiently induced (CAT, GPx) and no accumulation of H2O2 was detected. Exposure to low Cd concentrations (5 and 50 microM) caused an increase in GR, while 500 microM Cd led to an inhibition of GR and CAT. Increased glutathione concentrations were observed as a consequence of all Cd treatments. These results suggest that the antioxidative protection of the investigated strain of P. involutus was sufficient to avoid Cd-mediated oxidative stress. It is likely that this strain was able to detoxify high concentrations of Cd by transport of Cd into the vacuole because a high correlation between Cd and sulphur in the vacuole was detected by EDX.</em></small><br>[ID: 19709295]"

Guidot A, Debaud JC, Marmeisse R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In natural forest ecosystems several ectomycorrhizal fungal species cohabit on host plant root systems. To evaluate the ecological and functional impact of each species, it is necessary to appreciate the distribution and abundance of its mycelia in the soil. We developed a competitive PCR (cPCR) method for the basidiomycete Hebeloma cylindrosporum that allows quantification of its DNA in complex DNA mixtures extracted directly from soil samples. The target sequence chosen for the cPCR analysis was a 533-bp fragment of the nuclear ribosomal intergenic spacer, amplified using two species-specific primers. The detection threshold of the cPCR protocol developed was 0.03 pg of genomic DNA. This method was applied to soil samples collected from beneath and at various distances from a group of fruit bodies in a Pinus pinaster forest stand. The results revealed that H. cylindrosporum below-ground biomass was concentrated directly underneath the fruit bodies or very close to them, while no DNA of this species could be detected in soil samples collected at more than 50 cm away. In the vicinity of fruit bodies, H. cylindrosporum soil DNA concentration varied considerably (between 10 and 0.07 ng g soil(-1)) and decreased sharply with increased distance from the fruit bodies. This work demonstrates the potential of competitive quantitative PCR for the study of the distribution, abundance and persistence of the mycelia of an ectomycorrhizal fungal species in soil.</em></small><br>[ID: 19709306]"

Miyata N, Tani Y, Iwahori K, Soma M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A Mn-depositing fungus, Acremonium-like hyphomycete strain KR21-2, was isolated from a Mn deposit occurring on the wall of a storage bottle containing Mn(III, IV) oxide-coated streambed pebbles and stream water. 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain KR21-2 was phylogenetically related to members of the order Hypocreales within the class Ascomycetes. The spent culture medium at the stationary phase of fungal growth contained a 54-kDa protein capable of depositing Mn oxides. The enzymatic activity was inhibited by azide and o-phenanthroline. The Mn(II)-oxidizing protein possessed a laccase activity, as indicated by direct oxidation of p-phenylenediamine and 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). These results are consistent with the role assumed for laccase-like multicopper oxidase, which is proposed to be involved in the Mn(II)-oxidizing factors from some bacteria. Unlike laccases of basidiomycete fungi, however, the protein of strain KR21-2 did not produce soluble Mn(III) species in the presence of either of the Mn chelators pyrophosphate and malonate. This is the first report on the possible involvement of laccase and/or multicopper oxidase in Mn oxide deposition by ascomycetes (including their anamorphs) ubiquitous in natural environments.</em></small><br>[ID: 19712351]"

Torres Aquino M, Plassard C<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The aim of this work was to investigate the quantitative relationships between the rates of fungal soil exploration and their effects on plant growth and phosphorus (P) nutrition in soil with varying P availability. Ectomycorrhizal associations were established between Pinus pinaster and the basidiomycete Hebeloma cylindrosporum. Plants were grown for 4 and 6 months in mini-rhizoboxes filled with a 0.5 mm soil layer with two contrasting P levels (-P and +P soils), containing 3 or 50 mg of bicarbonate extractable P per kg of dry soil, respectively. Surface areas of the soil layers colonised by the roots and the hyphae were estimated using image analysis. High P availability decreased the rates of fungal soil colonisation, calculated as 0.92+/-0.19 cm(2) day(-1) plant(-1) in the -P soil and 0.42+/-0.1 cm(2) day(-1) plant(-1) in the +P soil over the 4-6 months period. Four-month old mycorrhizal plants accumulated lower amounts of biomass and total P than non-mycorrhizal plants, regardless the level of P availability. By contrast, 6-month old mycorrhizal plants were larger and contained more P than non-mycorrhizal plants, especially in the +P soil. However, mycorrhizal plants were always different from non-mycorrhizal P-deficient plants, which had an increased root surface and root P allocation. To explain these contradictory results, we propose that P accumulation by mycorrhizal plants derives mainly from fungal P uptake. The net P transfer from the fungus to the plant was estimated as 0.36 and 0.66 micromol of P per cm(2) of mycelium in -P and +P soil, respectively. Our data demonstrated that, despite the inhibitory effect of the high soil P availability on the rates of fungal soil colonisation, the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis was more efficient to improve host plant P nutrition in these conditions.</em></small><br>[ID: 19712398]"

The synthetic peptide caused strong in vitro growth inhibition (IC(50) value approximately 1 muM) of the pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum. Transgenic barley expressing the metchnikowin gene in its 52-amino acid pre-pro-peptide form under the control of the inducible mannopine synthase (mas) gene promoter from the T(i) plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens displayed enhanced resistance to powdery mildew as well as Fusarium head blight and root rot. In response to these pathogens, metchnikowin accumulated in plant apoplastic space, specifying that the insect signal peptide is functional in monocotyledons. In vitro and in vivo tests revealed that the peptide is markedly effective against fungal pathogens of the phylum Ascomycota but, clearly, less active against Basidiomycota fungi. Importantly, germination of the mutualistic basidiomycete mycorrhizal fungus Piriformospora indica was affected only at concentrations beyond 50 muM. These results suggest that antifungal peptides from insects are a valuable source for crop plant improvements and their differential activities toward different phyla of fungi denote a capacity for insect peptides to be used as selective measures on specific plant diseases.</em></small><br>[ID: 19734262]"

Kilaru S, Collins CM, Hartley AJ, Bailey AM, Foster GD<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We describe efficient polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation systems for a pharmaceutically important basidiomycete fungus, Clitopilus passeckerianus, which produces pleuromutilin, a diterpene antibiotic. Three dominant selectable marker systems based on hygromycin, phleomycin, and carboxin selection were used to study the feasibility of PEG-mediated transformation of C. passeckerianus. The PEG-mediated transformation of C. passeckerianus protoplasts was successful and generated hygromycin-resistant transformants more efficiently than either phleomycin or carboxin resistance. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with plasmid pBGgHg containing hph gene under the control of the Agaricus bisporus gpdII promoter led to hygromycin-resistant colonies and was successful when homogenized mycelium and fruiting body gill tissue were used as starting material. Southern blot analysis of transformants revealed the apparently random integration of the transforming DNA to be predominantly multiple copies for the PEG-mediated system and a single copy for the Agrobacterium-mediated system within the genome. C. passeckerianus actin and tubulin promoters were amplified from genomic DNA and proved successful in driving green fluorescent protein and DsRed expression in C. passeckerianus, but only when constructs contained a 5' intron, demonstrating that the presence of an intron is prerequisite for efficient transgene expression. The feasibility of RNA interference-mediated gene silencing was investigated using gfp as a target gene easily scored in C. passeckerianus. Upon transformation of gfp antisense constructs into a highly fluorescent strain, transformants were recovered that exhibited either reduced or undetectable fluorescence. This was confirmed by Northern blotting showing depletion of the target mRNA levels. This demonstrated that gene silencing is a suitable tool for modulating gene expression in C. passeckerianus. The molecular tools developed in this study should facilitate studies aimed at gene isolation or characterization in this pharmaceutically important species.</em></small><br>[ID: 19767458]"

AcH 505 inhibits Norway spruce root infection and colonisation by the root and butt rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum 005 but not by the congeneric strain Heterobasidion abietinum 331 because of higher sensitivity of H. annosum 005 towards the AcH 505-derived naphthoquinone antibiotic WS-5995 B. Differences in antibiotic sensitivity between two isolates belonging to two species, H. annosum 005 and H. abietinum 331, were investigated by comparative gene expression analysis using macroarrays and quantitative RT-PCR after WS-5995 B, structurally related mollisin and unrelated cycloheximide application. Treatment with 25 microM WS-5995 B for 2 h resulted in a significant up-regulation of expression of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase and GTPase genes, while the expression of genes encoding for thioredoxin and glutathione dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase was down-regulated in the sensitive fungal strain. No differential expression in the tolerant strain was detected. Application of WS-5995 B at higher concentrations over a time course experiment revealed that H. annosum 005 and H. abietinum 331 responded differently to WS-5995 B. The fungal gene expression levels depended on both the concentration of WS-5995 B and the duration of its application.

Significant isolation by distance effect was observed in Europe and Japan. Higher genetic variation was observed within the Japanese population than within the European population, corresponding with the observed higher richness of vegetative compatibility types in Japan, indicating that there has been a higher level of gene flow from the Asian source populations to Japan than to Europe. The European population is genetically more homogenous with only six detected vegetative compatibility types. Various tests indicate that both the European and the Japanese populations have gone through population bottlenecks prior to population expansion.

Idnurm A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycete fungus that is found worldwide and causes disease in humans and animal species. The fungus grows asexually as a budding yeast. Under laboratory conditions it is capable of sexual reproduction between two mating types. After cell fusion a dikaryotic filament develops, at the tip of which a basidium gives rise to four chains of basidiospores. Because the chains each comprise 10-30 spores, rather than single spores, the analysis of individual meiotic events has not been attempted in C. neoformans in the style of tetrad analyses performed in other fungal species. Here, the basidiospores from >100 basidia were micromanipulated and the resultant >2500 progeny analyzed for three genetic markers to understand the sexual process in this fungus, leading to four observations: (i) Marker segregation provides genetic evidence for a single meiotic event within the basidium followed by multiple rounds of mitosis. (ii) Using each basidium as an unordered tetrad, the ADE2 and URA5 genes are linked to their centromeres, consistent with adjacent genomic regions rich in repetitive elements predicted to comprise Cryptococcus centromeres. (iii) Lack of germination of basidiospores is attributed to aneuploidy, rather than dormancy. (iv) Analysis of basidiospores derived from single chains demonstrates that each chain can contain different genotypes. This mechanism of sexual spore production would benefit the species with a high rate of dispersal and at the same time aid in simultaneous dissemination of both mating types to new locations in the environment.</em></small><br>[ID: 20157004]"

García-Pedrajas MD, Nadal M, Denny T, Baeza-Montañez L, Paz Z, Gold SE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Gene deletion is one of the most powerful tools to study gene function. In the genomics era there is great demand for fast, simple high-throughput methods for gene deletion to study the roles of the large numbers of genes that are being identified. Here we present an approach that speeds up the process of generation of deletion mutants by greatly simplifying the production of gene deletion constructs. With this purpose we have developed a method, which we named DelsGate (Deletion via Gateway), that combines PCR and Gateway cloning technology together with the use of the I-SceI homing endonuclease to generate precise deletion constructs in a very simple, universal and robust manner in just 2 days. DelsGate consists of standard PCR of only the 5' and 3' 1 kb gene flanks directly followed by in vitro Gateway cloning and final generation of the circular deletion construct by in vivo recombination in Escherichia coli. For use in DelsGate we have modified a Gateway cloning vector to include selectable markers for the transformation of Ascomycetes and the Basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis. The PCR and transformation steps of DelsGate should be well suited for high-throughput approaches to gene deletion construction in fungal species.

Application of DelsGate to other fungal species is also underway. Additionally, we describe how this basic approach can be adapted to other genetic manipulations with minor changes.

Huang CH, Chang CC, Lin CM, Wang ST, Wu MT, Li EI, Chang HC, Lin CC<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>It is well known that DNA vaccines induce protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in several animal models. Antrodia camphorata (AC) is a unique basidiomycete fungus of the Polyporaceae family that only grows on the aromatic tree Cinnamomum kanehirai Hayata (Lauraceae) endemic to Taiwan. Importantly, AC has been shown to be highly beneficial in the treatment and prevention of cancer. The goal of this study was to investigate whether AC is able to augment the antitumor immune properties of a HER-2/neu DNA vaccine in a mouse model in which p185neu is overexpressed in MBT-2 tumor cells. Compared with the mice that received the HER-2/neu DNA vaccine alone, co-treatment with AC suppressed tumor growth and extended the survival rate. This increase in the antitumor efficacy was attributed to the enhancement of the Th1-like cellular immune response by the HER-2/neu DNA vaccine-AC combination. Evidence for this came from the marked increase in the IFN-gamma mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells in the draining inguinal lymph nodes, an increase in the number of functional HER-2/neu-specific CTLs, and the increased tumor infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, depletion of which abolishes the antitumor effect of the HER-2/neu DNA vaccine-AC therapy. Our results further indicate that the treatment of mice with AC enhanced DC activation and production of Th1-activating cytokines (e.g. IL-12, and IFN-alpha) in the draining lymph nodes, which were sufficient to directly stimulate T cell proliferation and higher IFN-gamma production in response to ErbB2. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that AC represents a promising immunomodulatory adjuvant that could enhance the therapeutic potency of HER-2/neu DNA vaccines in cancer therapy.</em></small><br>[ID: 20390417]"

Mancilla RA, Canessa P, Manubens A, Vicuña R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The ligninolytic machinery of the widely used model fungus Ceriporiopsis subvermispora includes the enzymes manganese-peroxidase (MnP) and laccase (Lcs).

However, almost no MnP enzyme was detected in the extracellular medium, either by enzymatic activity assays or Western blot hybridizations. In the corresponding mycelia, immuno-electron microscopy experiments showed high levels of MnP enzyme within intracellular compartments. These results suggest that in addition to its well-known effect on transcription regulation of mnp genes, manganese influences secretion of MnP to the extracellular medium.

There was no significant difference (p < or = 0.05) in decay effectiveness between storage methods for 12 of the fungus isolates tested. For the 2 fungi that showed a significant difference in the amount of decay with respect to storage method, 1 fungus (Fomitopsis lilacinogilva) produced more decay by the strain maintained as an agar slant, while the other fungus (Trametes versicolor) produced more decay by the strain stored in sterile water.

Idnurm A, Heitman J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Light is a universal signal perceived by organisms, including fungi, in which light regulates common and unique biological processes depending on the species. Previous research has established that conserved proteins, originally called White collar 1 and 2 from the ascomycete Neurospora crassa, regulate UV/blue light sensing. Homologous proteins function in distant relatives of N. crassa, including the basidiomycetes and zygomycetes, which diverged as long as a billion years ago. Here we conducted microarray experiments on the basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans to identify light-regulated genes. Surprisingly, only a single gene was induced by light above the commonly used twofold threshold. This gene, HEM15, is predicted to encode a ferrochelatase that catalyses the final step in haem biosynthesis from highly photoreactive porphyrins. The C. neoformans gene complements a Saccharomyces cerevisiae hem15Delta strain and is essential for viability, and the Hem15 protein localizes to mitochondria, three lines of evidence that the gene encodes ferrochelatase. Regulation of HEM15 by light suggests a mechanism by which bwc1/bwc2 mutants are photosensitive and exhibit reduced virulence. We show that ferrochelatase is also light-regulated in a white collar-dependent fashion in N. crassa and the zygomycete Phycomyces blakesleeanus, indicating that ferrochelatase is an ancient target of photoregulation in the fungal kingdom.</em></small><br>[ID: 20488877]"

Valinluck M, Ahlgren S, Sawada M, Locken K, Banuett F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ustilago maydis is a basidiomycete fungus that exhibits a yeast-like and a filamentous form. Growth of the fungus in the host leads to additional morphological transitions. The different morphologies are characterized by distinct nuclear movements. Dynein and alpha-tubulin are required for nuclear movements and for cell morphogenesis of the yeast-like form. Lis1 is a microtubule plus-end tracking protein (+TIPs) conserved in eukaryotes and required for nuclear migration and spindle positioning. Defects in nuclear migration result in altered cell fate and aberrant development in metazoans, slow growth in fungi and disease in humans (e.g. lissencephaly). Here we investigate the role of the human LIS1 homolog in U. maydis and demonstrate that it is essential for cell viability, not previously seen in other fungi. With a conditional null mutation we show that lis1 is necessary for nuclear migration in the yeast-like cell and during the dimorphic transition. Studies of asynchronous exponentially growing cells and time-lapse microscopy uncovered novel functions of lis1: It is necessary for cell morphogenesis, positioning of the septum and cell wall integrity. lis1-depleted cells exhibit altered axes of growth and loss of cell polarity leading to grossly aberrant cells with clusters of nuclei and morphologically altered buds devoid of nuclei. Altered septum positioning and cell wall deposition contribute to the aberrant morphology. lis1-depleted cells lyse, indicative of altered cell wall properties or composition. We also demonstrate, with indirect immunofluorescence to visualize tubulin, that lis1 is necessary for the normal organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton: lis1-depleted cells contain more and longer microtubules that can form coils perpendicular to the long axis of the cell. We propose that lis1 controls microtubule dynamics and thus the regulated delivery of vesicles to growth sites and other cell domains that govern nuclear movements.</em></small><br>[ID: 20524583]"

Kües U, Navarro-González M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The cacao-pathogenic Moniliophthora perniciosa C-biotype is a primarily homothallic Agaricomycete of which the genome has recently become available. Searching of the genome sequence with mating type proteins from other basidiomycetes detected one or possibly two potential genes for HD1 homeodomain transcription factors, 7 or possibly 8 genes for potential pheromone receptors and five genes for putative pheromone precursors. Apparently, the fungus possesses gene functions encoded in the tetrapolar basidiomycetes in the A and B mating loci, respectively. In the tetrapolar species, the A and B mating type genes govern formation of clamp cells at hyphal septa of the dikaryon and their fusion with sub-apical cells as well as mushroom production. The C-biotype forms fused clamp cells and also basidiocarps on mycelia germinated from basidiospores and their development might be controlled by the detected genes. It represents the first example of a primarily homothallic basidiomycete where A - and B -mating-type-like genes were found. Various strategies are discussed as how self-compatibility in presence of such genes can evolve. An A -mating-type like gene for an HD2 homeodomain transcription factor is, however, not included in the available sequence representing estimated 69% coverage of the haploid genome but there are non-mating genes for other homeodomain transcription factors of currently unknown function that are conserved in basidiomycetes and also various ascomycetes.</em></small><br>[ID: 20586074]"

Zymogram assays of laccases secreted by the fungus growing on WSFA and WSFA supplemented with glucose showed two bands with isoelectric points of 3.3 and 3.4. The kinetic studies of the two purified isoenzymes showed similar affinity on 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), used as phenolic and non-phenolic model substrate, respectively. The molecular mass of both proteins was 66 kDa with 9% N-linked carbohydrate. Physico-chemical properties of the purified laccases from media containing WSFA were similar to those obtained from medium with glucose as the main carbon source. In-vitro studies performed with the purified laccases revealed a 42% phenol reduction of WSFA, as well as changes in the molecular mass distribution. These findings indicate that these laccases are involved in the process of transformation, via polymerization by the oxidation of phenolic compounds present in WSFA. A single laccase gene, containing an open reading frame of 1,488 bp, was obtained in PCR amplifications performed with cDNA extracted from mycelia grown on WSFA. The product of the gene shares 90% identity (95% similarity) with a laccase from Trametes trogii and 89% identity (95% similarity) with a laccase from Coriolopsis gallica.

The aims of this work were to quantify the activity and spatial distribution of extracellular enzymes in coarse wood colonised by the white-rot basidiomycete Fomes fomentarius and in adjacent fruitbodies of the fungus and to analyse the diversity of the fungal and bacterial community in a fungus-colonised wood and its potential effect on enzyme production by F. fomentarius. Fungus-colonised wood and fruitbodies were collected in low management intensity forests in the Czech Republic. There were significant differences in enzyme production by F. fomentarius between Betula pendula and Fagus sylvatica wood, the activity of cellulose and xylan-degrading enzymes was significantly higher in beech wood than in birch wood. Spatial analysis of a sample B. pendula log segment proved that F. fomentarius was the single fungal representative found in the log. There was a high level of spatial variability in the amount of fungal biomass detected, but no effects on enzyme activities were observed. Samples from the fruiting body showed high β-glucosidase and chitinase activities compared to wood samples. Significantly higher levels of xylanase and cellobiohydrolase were found in samples located near the fruitbody (proximal), and higher laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities were found in the distal ones. The microbial community in wood was dominated by the fungus (fungal to bacterial DNA ratio of 62-111). Bacterial abundance composition was lower in proximal than distal parts of wood by a factor of 24. These results show a significant level of spatial heterogeneity in coarse wood. One of the explanations may be the successive colonization of wood by the fungus: due to differential enzyme production, the rates of biodegradation of coarse wood are also spatially inhomogeneous.</em></small><br>[ID: 20668917]"

Leal GA, Gomes LH, Albuquerque PS, Tavares FC, Figueira A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Moniliophthora perniciosa is the causal agent of witches' broom disease of Theobroma cacao (cacao). Pathogenesis mechanisms of this hemibiotrophic fungus are largely unknown. An approach to identify putative pathogenicity genes is searching for sequences induced in mycelia grown under in vitro conditions. Using this approach, genes from M. perniciosa induced under limiting nitrogen and light were identified from a cDNA library enriched by suppression subtractive hybridization as potential putative pathogenicity genes. From the 159 identified unique sequences, 59 were annotated and classified by gene ontology. Two sequences were categorized as \"Defence genes, Virulence, and Cell response\" presumably coding for allergenic proteins, whose homologues from other fungi are inducers of animal or plant defences. Differential gene expression was evaluated by quantitative amplification of reversed transcripts (RT-qPCR) of the putative identified genes coding for the two allergenic proteins (Aspf13 and 88KD), and for the enzymes Arylsulfatase (AS); Aryl-Alcohol Oxidase; Aldo-Keto Reductase (AK); Cytochrome P450 (P450); Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase; and Peroxidase from mycelia grown under contrasting N concentrations. All genes were validated for differential expression, except for the putative Peroxidase. The same eight genes were analysed for expression in susceptible plants inoculated with M. perniciosa, and six were induced during the early asymptomatic stage of the disease. In infected host tissues, transcripts of 88KD and AS were found more abundant at the biotrophic phase, while those from Aspf13, AK, PAL, and P450 accumulated at the necrotrophic phase, enabling to suggest that mycelia transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic might occur earlier than currently considered. These sequences appeared to be virulence life-style genes, which encode factors or enzymes that enable invasion, colonization or intracellular survival, or manipulate host factors to benefit the pathogen's own survival in the hostile environment.</em></small><br>[ID: 20943194]"

Dalman K, Olson A, Stenlid J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We investigated two hypotheses for the origin of the root rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum species complex: (i) that geology has been an important factor for the speciation (ii) that co-evolutionary processes with the hosts drove the divergence of the pathogen species. The H. annosum species complex consists of five species: three occur in Europe, H. annosum s.s., Heterobasidion parviporum and Heterobasidion abietinum, and two in North America, Heterobasidion irregulare and Heterobasidion occidentale; all with different but partially overlapping host preferences. The evolution of the H. annosum species complex was studied using six partially sequenced genes, between 10 and 30 individuals of each species were analysed. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed for each gene, and a Bayesian tree was built for the combined data set. In addition, haplotype networks were constructed to illustrate the species relationships. For three of the genes, H. parviporum and H. abietinum share haplotypes supporting recent divergence and/or possible gene flow. We propose that the H. annosum species complex originated in Laurasia and that the H. annosum s.s./H. irregulare and H. parviporum/H. abietinum/H. occidentale ancestral species emerged between 45 and 60 Ma in the Palaearctic, well after the radiation of the host genera. Our data imply that H. irregulare and H. occidentale were colonizing North America via different routes. In conclusion, plate tectonics are likely to have been the main factor influencing Heterobasidion speciation and biogeography.</em></small><br>[ID: 20964759]"

The virus could be experimentally transmitted to members of the Heterobasidion annosum complex: the European Heterobasidion abietinum and North American Heterobasidion occidentale, and the original host strain could be cured from the virus by thermal treatment. Microscopical observations showed that hyphae of H. ecrustosum anastomosed occasionally with H. abietinum and H. occidentale, and suggested a possible route for horizontal transmission between these sexually incompatible species.

Ruiz-González MX, Malé PJ, Leroy C, Dejean A, Gryta H, Jargeat P, Quilichini A, Orivel J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ant-fungus associations are well known from attine ants, whose nutrition is based on a symbiosis with basidiomycete fungi. Otherwise, only a few non-nutritional ant-fungus associations have been recorded to date. Here we focus on one of these associations involving Allomerus plant-ants that build galleried structures on their myrmecophytic hosts in order to ambush prey. We show that this association is not opportunistic because the ants select from a monophyletic group of closely related fungal haplotypes of an ascomycete species from the order Chaetothyriales that consistently grows on and has been isolated from the galleries. Both the ants' behaviour and an analysis of the genetic population structure of the ants and the fungus argue for host specificity in this interaction. The ants' behaviour reveals a major investment in manipulating, growing and cleaning the fungus. A molecular analysis of the fungus demonstrates the widespread occurrence of one haplotype and many other haplotypes with a lower occurrence, as well as significant variation in the presence of these fungal haplotypes between areas and ant species. Altogether, these results suggest that such an interaction might represent an as-yet undescribed type of specific association between ants and fungus in which the ants cultivate fungal mycelia to strengthen their hunting galleries.</em></small><br>[ID: 21084334]"

James TY, Lee M, van Diepen LT<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The white-rot basidiomycete fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Agaricomycetes) is a model species that produces potent wood-degrading enzymes. The mating system of the species has been difficult to characterize due to its cryptic fruiting habit and lack of clamp connections in the heterokaryotic phase. By exploiting the draft genome sequence, we reevaluated the mating system of P. chrysosporium by studying the inheritance and segregation of putative mating-type gene homologues, the homeodomain transcription factor genes (MAT-A) and the pheromone receptors (MAT-B). A pattern of mating incompatibility and fructification consistent with a bipolar system with a single MAT locus was observed, but the rejection response was much weaker than that seen in other agaricomycete species, leading to stable heterokaryons with identical MAT alleles. The homeodomain genes appear to comprise the single MAT locus because they are heterozygous in wild strains and hyperpolymorphic at the DNA sequence level and promote aspects of sexual reproduction, such as nuclear migration, heterokaryon stability, and basidiospore formation. The pheromone receptor loci that might constitute a MAT-B locus, as in many other Agaricomycetes, are not linked to the MAT-A locus and display low levels of polymorphism. This observation is inconsistent with a bipolar mating system that includes pheromones and pheromone receptors as mating-type determinants. The partial uncoupling of nuclear migration and mating incompatibility in this species may be predicted to lead to parasexual recombination and may have contributed to the homothallic behavior observed in previous studies.</em></small><br>[ID: 21131435]"

Xiao YZ, Chen Q, Hang J, Shi YY, Xiao YZ, Wu J, Hong YZ, Wang YP<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The white-rot fungus Trametes sp. AH28-2 can synthesize extracellular laccase by induction in cellobiose-based liquid culture medium. Both yields and composition of laccase isozymes, produced by Trametes sp. AH28-2, would be quite different with induction by different small-molecule aromatic compounds, o-toluidine, guaiacol and 3,5-dihydroxytoluene, which affected microbial growth and the synthesis of laccase isozymes differentially. Higher concentrations of the three inducers could considerably increase laccase isozymes yields but not change the laccase composition. Coculturing of Trametes sp. AH28-2 with either Aspergillus oryzae or Gloeophyllum trabeum showed a few effects on laccase production. Laccase isozyme, laccase B, was selectively induced by 3,5-dihydroxytoluene and purified to homogeneity by two-step chromatography. Purified laccase B appeared as blue, with a broad peak at about 600 nm and a shoulder peak at about 330 nm. The ratio of absorbance at 280 nm to that at 600 nm was 21. Every molecule of laccase B had approximately four copper atoms. Molecular mass of laccase B was estimated to be 74 kDa on SDS-PAGE, 72 kDa by FPLC and was determined to be 71 454 Da by mass spectrum. After being treated with N-glycosidase F, laccase B lost 25% of its molecular mass. The isoelectric point of laccase B was 4.0. Its optimal pH and temperature for oxidizing guaiacol were respectively 4.7 and 45 C. The half-life of the enzyme at 60 C was 14.0 min. The enzyme showed a good stability in a range of pH value of 3.5-7.5. The K(m) values of the enzyme toward substrates syringaldazine, guaiacol, ABTS, and DMOP were respectively 28.0, 1249.0, 177.0 and 109.8 μM. The corresponding V(max) are 504.0, 1910.0, 117.4 and 159.0 μM min(-1) mg(-1). In addition, activity of laccase B was inhibited strongly by sodium azide and cyanide, mildly by SDS and trifluoroacetic acid, but only weakly by dimethyl sulfoxide.</em></small><br>[ID: 21148825]"

Luo H, Mo M, Huang X, Li X, Zhang K<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Nematophagous basidiomycete fungi kill nematodes by trapping, endoparasitizing and producing toxin. In our studies Coprinus comatus (O.F.Müll. : Fr.) Pers. is found to be a nematode-destroying fungus; this fungus immobilizes, kills and uses free-living nematode Panagrellus redivivus Goodey and root-knot nematode Meloidogyne arenaria Neal. C. comatus produces an unusual structure designated spiny ball. Set on a sporophore-like branch, the spiny ball is a burr-like structure assembled with a large number of tiny tubes. Purified spiny balls exhibit moderate nematicidal activity. Experiments show that spiny balls are not chlamydospores because of the absence of nuclei in the structures and quick formation within 3 d in a young colony. Nematodes added to C. comatus cultures on potato-dextrose agar (PDA) and cornmeal agar (CMA) become inactive in hours. Infection of nematodes by the fungus occurs only after the nematodes are immobilized (feeble or dead), probably by a toxin. Electron micrographs illustrate that C. comatus infect P. redivivus by producing penetration pegs with which hyphae colonize nematode bodies. An infected nematode is digested and consumed within days and hyphae grow out of the nematode.</em></small><br>[ID: 21148944]"

Therefore, possible mechanisms of P. indica improving host plant yield were tested in outdoor experiments: Induction of higher grain yield in barley was independent of elevated pathogen levels and independent of different phosphate fertilization levels. In contrast to the arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Glomus mosseae total phosphate contents of host plant roots and shoots were not significantly affected by P. indica. Analysis of plant development and yield parameters indicated that positive effects of P. indica on grain yield are due to accelerated growth of barley plants early in development.</em></small><br>[ID: 21150264]"

The effect of copper on in vitro production of extracellular ligninolytic activities was studied. CuSO(4)·5H(2)O concentrations from 1.6 μM to 1.5 mM were tested in a synthetic medium with glucose 20 g/L and asparagine 3 g/L. The addition of copper (up to 1 mM) did not affect growth but strongly stimulated ligninolytic enzyme production; faster decolorization of the polymeric dye Poly R-478 was observed as well. Maximal production of manganese peroxidase, laccase, and glyoxal oxidase [1.28 U/mL, 93.8 U/mL (with a specific activity of 720 U/mg protein), and 0.46 U/mL respectively] was attained with 1 mM CuSO(4)·5H(2)O. However, higher copper concentrations inhibited growth and notably decreased manganese peroxidase production, although they did not affect laccase secretion. Laccase activity in the culture filtrate was maximal at 50 C and pH 3.4, and the enzyme was completely stable at pH 4.4 and above, and at 30 C for up to 5 d. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of extracellular culture fluids showed two laccase activity bands (mol wt 38 and 60 kDa respectively).

Kauserud H, Schumacher T<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The population structure of 11 Fennoscandian geographic populations of the pioneer wood-decay basidiomycete Trichaptum abietinum was assessed with PCR-RFLPs, intersequence simple repeats (ISSRs) and mating studies. The three codominant PCR-RFLP markers (1) internal transcribed spacer 2 (nrDNA), (2) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and (3) translation elongation factor 1α showed that genotype distributions in most cases (94%) agreed with Hardy-Weinberg expectations and that random association of alleles occurred across loci. The molecular data suggest that T. abietinum is a highly outcrossing fungus that regularly proliferates and spreads by sexual spores. Interstock mating reactions suggest a high number of mating factors among individuals and that biological barriers to gene flow are nonexistent in the region. The three PCR-RFLP loci gave an overall F(ST) = 0.03, indicating a low level of genetic differentiation and presumably high gene flow among the geographic populations. The ISSR markers revealed no systematic substructuring and the among-population variance component was low (6.1%) in AMOVA. However, all PCR-RFLP and most ISSR markers (7/12) showed significant deviation from the null hypothesis of an even distribution of allele frequencies across the 11 geographic populations. Allele frequencies varied in an apparently random manner, suggesting that genetic drift might be an important structuring factor in T. abietinum. The spatial small-scale distribution of heterokaryons on three selected substrate units (logs) showed that most isolates represented discrete individuals and that a number of genets (19) may occupy a single log. The small-scale genotype distributions (within logs) were in agreement with panmictic Hardy-Weinberg expectations.</em></small><br>[ID: 21156630]"

Xu Z, Chen X, Zhong Z, Chen L, Wang Y<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum), a basidiomycete white rot fungus, has long been prescribed to prevent and treat various human diseases, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea. Several classes of bioactive substances have been isolated and identified from G. lucidum, such as triterpenoids, polysaccharides, nucleosides, sterols, and alkaloids, among others. This paper examines the potential role of G. lucidum polysaccharide (GLPS) in tumor therapy and the possible mechanisms involved. Both in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that the anti-tumor activities of GLPS are mediated by its immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic, and cytotoxic effects. GLPS affects immune cells and immune-related cells including B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells. In addition, recent data also suggest that GLPS suppresses tumorigenesis or inhibits tumor growth through direct cytotoxic effect and anti-angiogenic actions. However, many questions still need to be answered before both G. lucidum and GLPS can be widely accepted and used as anti-tumor agents.</em></small><br>[ID: 21213395]"

Ji HW, Cha CJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The brown-rot basidiomycete Fomitopsis palustris is known to degrade crystalline cellulose (Avicel) and produce three major cellulases, exoglucanases, endoglucanases, and β-glucosidases. A novel β-glucosidase designated as Cel3A was identified from F. palustris grown at the expense of Avicel. The deduced amino acid sequence of Cel3A showed high homology with those of other fungal β-glucosidases that belong to glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 3. The sequence analysis also indicated that Cel3A contains the N- and C-terminal domains of GH family 3 and Asp-209 was conserved as a catalytic nucleophile. The cloned gene was successfully expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and the recombinant protein exhibited β-glucosidase activity with cellobiose and some degree of thermostability. Considering the size and sequence of the protein, the β-glucosidase identified in this study is different from the protein purified directly from F. palustris in the previous study. Our results suggest that the fungus possesses at least two β-glucosidase genes.</em></small><br>[ID: 21221939]"

Yelle DJ, Wei D, Ralph J, Hammel KE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Lignocellulose biodegradation, an essential step in terrestrial carbon cycling, generally involves removal of the recalcitrant lignin barrier that otherwise prevents infiltration by microbial polysaccharide hydrolases. However, fungi that cause brown rot of wood, a major route for biomass recycling in coniferous forests, utilize wood polysaccharides efficiently while removing little of the lignin. The mechanism by which these basidiomycetes breach the lignin remains unclear. We used recently developed methods for solubilization and multidimensional (1) H-(13) C solution-state NMR spectroscopy of ball-milled lignocellulose to analyse aspen wood degraded by Postia placenta. The results showed that decay decreased the content of the principal arylglycerol-β-aryl ether interunit linkage in the lignin by more than half, while increasing the frequency of several truncated lignin structures roughly fourfold over the level found in sound aspen. These new end-groups, consisting of benzaldehydes, benzoic acids and phenylglycerols, accounted for 6-7% of all original lignin subunits. Our results provide evidence that brown rot by P. placenta results in significant ligninolysis, which might enable infiltration of the wood by polysaccharide hydrolases even though the partially degraded lignin remains in situ. Recent work has revealed that the P. placenta genome encodes no ligninolytic peroxidases, but has also shown that this fungus produces an extracellular Fenton system. It is accordingly likely that P. placenta employs electrophilic reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals to disrupt lignin in wood.</em></small><br>[ID: 21261800]"

Kemppainen M, Duplessis S, Martin F, Pardo AG<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ectomycorrhiza is a mutualistic symbiosis formed between fine roots of trees and the mycelium of soil fungi. This symbiosis plays a key role in forest ecosystems for the mineral nutrition of trees and the biology of the fungal communities associated. The characterization of genes involved in developmental and metabolic processes is important to understand the complex interactions that control the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer (AMT) in fungi is currently opening a new era for fungal research. As whole genome sequences of several fungi are being released studies about T-DNA integration patterns are needed in order to understand the integration mechanisms involved and to evaluate the AMT as an insertional mutagenesis tool for different fungal species. The first genome sequence of a mycorrhizal fungus, the basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor, became public in July 2006. Release of Laccaria genome sequence and the availability of AMT makes this fungus an excellent model for functional genomic studies in ectomycorrhizal research. No data on the integration pattern in Laccaria genome were available, thus we optimized a plasmid rescue approach for this fungus. To this end the transformation vector (pHg/pBSk) was constructed allowing the rescue of the T-DNA right border (RB)-genomic DNA junctions in Escherichia coli. Fifty-one Agrobacterium-transformed fungal strains, picked up at random from a larger collection of T-DNA tagged strains (about 500), were analysed. Sixty-nine per cent were successfully rescued for the RB of which 87% were resolved for genomic integration sequences. Our results demonstrate that the plasmid rescue approach can be used for resolving T-DNA integration sites in Laccaria. The RB was well conserved during transformation of this fungus and the integration analysis showed no clear sequence homology between different genomic sites. Neither obvious sequence similarities were found between these sites and the T-DNA borders indicating non-homologous integration of the transgenes. Majority (75%) of the integrations were located in predicted genes. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is a powerful tool that can be used for functional gene studies in Laccaria and will be helpful along with plasmid rescue in searching for relevant fungal genes involved in the symbiotic process.</em></small><br>[ID: 21261845]"

Kemppainen MJ, Pardo AG<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ectomycorrhiza (ECM) is a mutualistic association between fungi and the roots of the vast majority of trees. These include numerous ecologically and economically relevant species and the participating fungal symbionts are predominantly filamentous basidiomycetes. In natural ecosystems the plant nutrient uptake from soil takes place via the extraradical mycelia of these ECM mycosimbionts as a trade for plant photosyntates. The symbiotic phase in the life cycle of ECM basidiomycetes is the dikaryotic hyphae. Therefore, studies on symbiotic relevant gene functions require the inactivation of both gene copies in these dikaryotic fungi. RNA silencing is a eukaryotic sequence homology-dependent degradation of target RNAs which is believed to have evolved as a protection mechanism against invading nucleic acids. In different eukaryotic organisms, including fungi, the RNA silencing pathway can be artificially triggered to target and degrade gene transcripts of interest, resulting in gene knock-down. Most importantly, RNA silencing can act at the cytosolic level affecting mRNAs originating from several gene copies and different nuclei thus offering an efficient means of altering gene expression in dikaryotic organisms. Therefore, the pHg/pSILBAγ silencing vector was constructed for efficient RNA silencing triggering in the model mycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor. This cloning vector carries the Agaricus bisporus gpdII-promoter, two multiple cloning sites separated by a L. bicolor nitrate reductase intron and the Aspergillus nidulans trpC terminator. pSILBAγ allows an easy two-step PCR-cloning of hairpin sequences to be expressed in basidiomycetes. With one further cloning step into pHg, a pCAMBIA1300-based binary vector carrying a hygromycin resistance cassette, makes the pHg/pSILBAγ plasmid compatible with Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The pHg/pSILBAγ-system results in predominantly single integrations of RNA silencing triggering T-DNAs in the fungal genome and the integration sites of the transgenes can be resolved by plasmid rescue. Besides the optimized use in L. bicolor, general consideration was taken to build a vector system with maximum compatibility with other homobasidiomycetes and different transformation techniques.</em></small><br>[ID: 21326837]"

Dietz S, von Bülow J, Beitz E, Nehls U<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Soil humidity and bulk water transport are essential for nutrient mobilization. Ectomycorrhizal fungi, bridging soil and fine roots of woody plants, are capable of modulating both by being integrated into water movement driven by plant transpiration and the nocturnal hydraulic lift. Aquaporins are integral membrane proteins that function as gradient-driven water and/or solute channels. Seven aquaporins were identified in the genome of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor and their role in fungal transfer processes was analyzed. Heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed relevant water permeabilities for three aquaporins. In fungal mycelia, expression of the corresponding genes was high compared with other members of the gene family, indicating the significance of the respective proteins for plasma membrane water permeability. As growth temperature and ectomycorrhiza formation modified gene expression profiles of these water-conducting aquaporins, specific roles in those aspects of fungal physiology are suggested. Two aquaporins, which were highly expressed in ectomycorrhizas, conferred plasma membrane ammonia permeability in yeast. This indicates that these proteins are an integral part of ectomycorrhizal fungus-based plant nitrogen nutrition in symbiosis.</em></small><br>[ID: 21352231]"

To determine the importance of oxalate as a source of ROS for OA- and NLP-induced cell death, a full-length cDNA coding for an oxalate decarboxylase (FvOXDC) from the basidiomycete Flammulina velutipes, which converts OA into CO(2) and formate, was overexpressed in tobacco plants. The transgenic plants contained less OA and more formic acid compared with the control plants and showed enhanced resistance to cell death induced by exogenous OA and MpNEP2, an NLP of the hemibiotrophic fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa. This resistance was correlated with the inhibition of ROS formation in the transgenic plants inoculated with OA, MpNEP2, or a combination of both PCD elicitors. Taken together, these results have established a pivotal function for oxalate as a source of ROS required for the PCD-inducing activity of OA and NLP. The results also indicate that FvOXDC represents a potentially novel source of resistance against OA- and NLP-producing pathogens such as M. perniciosa, the causal agent of witches' broom disease of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.).</em></small><br>[ID: 21405988]"

Jacobs S, Zechmann B, Molitor A, Trujillo M, Petutschnig E, Lipka V, Kogel KH, Schäfer P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Piriformospora indica is a root-colonizing basidiomycete that confers a wide range of beneficial traits to its host. The fungus shows a biotrophic growth phase in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots followed by a cell death-associated colonization phase, a colonization strategy that, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported for this plant. P. indica has evolved an extraordinary capacity for plant root colonization. Its broad host spectrum encompasses gymnosperms and monocotyledonous as well as dicotyledonous angiosperms, which suggests that it has an effective mechanism(s) for bypassing or suppressing host immunity. The results of our work argue that P. indica is confronted with a functional root immune system. Moreover, the fungus does not evade detection but rather suppresses immunity triggered by various microbe-associated molecular patterns. This ability to suppress host immunity is compromised in the jasmonate mutants jasmonate insensitive1-1 and jasmonate resistant1-1. A quintuple-DELLA mutant displaying constitutive gibberellin (GA) responses and the GA biosynthesis mutant ga1-6 (for GA requiring 1) showed higher and lower degrees of colonization, respectively, in the cell death-associated stage, suggesting that P. indica recruits GA signaling to help establish proapoptotic root cell colonization. Our study demonstrates that mutualists, like pathogens, are confronted with an effective innate immune system in roots and that colonization success essentially depends on the evolution of strategies for immunosuppression.</em></small><br>[ID: 21474434]"

Kooij PW, Schiøtt M, Boomsma JJ, De Fine Licht HH<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungus gardens of the basidiomycete Leucocoprinus gongylophorus sustain large colonies of leaf-cutting ants by degrading the plant material collected by the ants. Recent studies have shown that enzyme activity in these gardens is primarily targeted toward starch, proteins and the pectin matrix associated with cell walls, rather than toward structural cell wall components such as cellulose and hemicelluloses. Substrate constituents are also known to be sequentially degraded in different sections of the fungus garden. To test the plasticity in the extracellular expression of fungus-garden enzymes, we measured the changes in enzyme activity after a controlled shift in fungal substrate offered to six laboratory colonies of Atta cephalotes. An ant diet consisting exclusively of grains of parboiled rice rapidly increased the activity of endo-proteinases and some of the pectinases attacking the backbone structure of pectin molecules, relative to a pure diet of bramble leaves, and this happened predominantly in the most recently established top sections of fungus gardens. However, fungus-garden amylase activity did not significantly increase despite the substantial increase in starch availability from the rice diet, relative to the leaf diet controls. Enzyme activity in the older, bottom sections of fungus gardens decreased, indicating a faster processing of the rice substrate compared to the leaf diet. These results suggest that leaf-cutting ant fungus gardens can rapidly adjust enzyme activity to provide a better match with substrate availability and that excess starch that is not protected by cell walls may be digested by the ants rather than by the fungus-garden symbiont.

Adler A, Park YD, Larsen P, Nagarajan V, Wollenberg K, Qiu J, Myers TG, Williamson PR<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Eukaryotic cells utilize complex signaling systems to detect their environments, responding and adapting as new conditions arise during evolution. The basidiomycete fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is a leading cause of AIDS-related death worldwide and utilizes the calcineurin and protein kinase C-1 (Pkc1) signaling pathways for host adaptation and expression of virulence. In the present studies, a C-terminal zinc finger transcription factor, homologous both to the calcineurin-responsive zinc fingers (Crz1) of ascomycetes and to the Pkc1-dependent specificity protein-1 (Sp1) transcription factors of metazoans, was identified and named SP1 because of its greater similarity to the metazoan factors. Structurally, the Cryptococcus neoformans Sp1 (Cn Sp1) protein was found to have acquired an additional zinc finger motif from that of Crz1 and showed Pkc1-dependent phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and whole genome epistatic associations under starvation conditions. Transcriptional targets of Cn Sp1 shared functional similarities with Crz1 factors, such as cell wall synthesis, but gained the regulation of processes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including trehalose metabolism, and lost others, such as the induction of autophagy. In addition, overexpression of Cn Sp1 in a pkc1Δ mutant showed restoration of altered phenotypes involved in virulence, including cell wall stability, nitrosative stress, and extracellular capsule production. Cn Sp1 was also found to be important for virulence of the fungus using a mouse model. In summary, these data suggest an evolutionary shift in C-terminal zinc finger proteins during fungal evolution, transforming them from calcineurin-dependent to PKC1-dependent transcription factors, helping to shape the role of fungal pathogenesis of C. neoformans.</em></small><br>[ID: 21487010]"

Although the effectiveness of P. gigantea in biocontrol has been shown empirically, the long-term effect on living conifer trees as well as the mechanism underlying its antagonistic activity is still unknown. An additional concern is the potential of P. gigantea to acquire a necrotrophic habit through adaptation to living wood tissues. By using a combination of histochemical, molecular and transcript profiling (454 sequencing), we investigated under in vitro conditions the necrotrophic capability of P. gigantea and induced localized resistance as a mechanism for its biocontrol action. Pinus sylvestris seedlings (10 years old) were challenged on the xylem surface with P. gigantea or H. annosum. Both fungi provoked strong necrotic lesions, but after prolonged incubation, P. gigantea lesions shrank and ceased to expand further. Tree seedlings pre-treated with P. gigantea further restricted H. annosum-induced necrosis and had more lignified cells. The 454 sequencing revealed elevated transcript levels of genes important for lignification, cell death regulation and jasmonic acid signalling. The results suggest that induced localized resistance is a contributory factor for the biocontrol efficacy of P. gigantea, and it has a limited necrotrophic capability compared with H. annosum.</em></small><br>[ID: 21551358]"

Hori C, Igarashi K, Katayama A, Samejima M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Lignocellulosic biomass contains cellulose and xylan as major structural components, and starch as a storage polysaccharide. In the present study, we have used comparative secretomic analysis to examine the effects of xylan and starch on the expression level of proteins secreted by the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium grown on cellulose,. Forty-seven spots of extracellular proteins expressed by P. chrysosporium separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Addition of starch to the cellulolytic culture did not affect fungal growth significantly, but did decrease the production of total extracellular enzymes, including cellulases and xylanases. In contrast, addition of xylan increased mycelial volume and the production of extracellular proteins. Xylan increased synthesis of several glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 putative endoxylanases and a putative glucuronoyl esterase belonging to carbohydrate esterase family 15, for which plant cell wall xylan may be a substrate. Moreover, cellobiose dehydrogenase and GH family 61 proteins, which are known to promote cellulose degradation, were also increased in the presence of xylan. These enzymes may contribute to degradation by the fungus of not only cellulose but also complex carbohydrate components of the plant cell wall.</em></small><br>[ID: 21569082]"

Associated with these are desolate and environmentally damaging hills of ash and semicoke tailings. Interestingly, some of the first plants to colonize these hills are rare orchids. Here, we assess the identities of the mycorrhizal fungi associated with these orchids, in particular Epipactis atrorubens, Orchis militaris, and Dactylorhiza baltica, and compare them with mycorrhizal fungi from orchids from pristine habitat. Epipactis atrorubens associated with the widest breadth of fungi, including unnamed members of the basidiomycete family Tulasnellaceae and the potentially ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes Trichophaea woolhopeia and Geopora cooperi. Orchis militaris also associated with unnamed members of the Tulasnellaceae. Dactylorhiza baltica associated with Ceratobasidium albasitensis. In Epipactis and Orchis, the same fungi associated with plants in the pristine habitat as with those on ash hills. The tulasnelloid and ceratobasidioid fungi mycorrhizal with these orchids appear closely related to common orchid mycorrhizal fungi, while one of the ascomycetes mycorrhizal with E. atrorubens is closely related to a mycorrhizal fungus with E. microphylla. Our results suggest that these orchids and their fungi are not limited to pristine habitats and that environmentally polluted sites may present novel habitats that may be exploited for endangered plant conservation.</em></small><br>[ID: 21632341]"

Lawrey JD, Diederich P, Sikaroodi M, Gillevet PM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungi in the basidiomycete order Corticiales are remarkably diverse nutritionally, including a variety of saprotrophs, plant and fungal pathogens, and lichen-forming fungi. Tracing the origin of this diversity depends on a clearer understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of fungi in the order. One of its core members is the genus Marchandiomyces, originally established for lichen pathogens that form orange or coral bulbils. We describe here a new species in the genus, M. marsonii sp. nov., which is unusual in its appearance, habit, and geographic provenance. It is foliicolous on leaves of Pandanus (screw pines, Pandanaceae) and produces flattened, coral bulbils resembling apothecia of the ascomycete genus Orbilia. It is also the first member of the genus to be collected from Australia. An isolate of the new fungus and several additional cultures of related plant pathogenic fungi were obtained and investigated phylogenetically using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of nuclear small and large subunit ribosomal sequences. Our phylogeny makes clear that Marchandiomyces species and their close relatives contribute significantly to the ecological diversity of the Corticiales and that this diversity is derived mainly from lignicolous ancestors.</em></small><br>[ID: 21632407]"

In this paper, the cytoplasmic order of hyphal tip cells of Basidiobolus sp., a zygomycete genus of uncertain phylogeny, has been examined using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy methods. With phase-contrast light optics, a phase-dark body was observed at the tips of growing hyphae of Basidiobolus sp. The hyphal apex also showed high affinity for FM4-64 labelling resulting in an intense fluorescence signal. The phase-dark inclusion exhibited independent motility within the hyphal apex and its presence and position were correlated to the rate and direction of hyphal growth. The hyphal apex of Basidiobolus sp. did not contain γ-tubulin. Ultrastructural observations revealed a dense cluster of vesicles at the hyphal apex. These results suggest that the growing hypha of Basidiobolus sp. contains a Spitzenkörper, a character generally attributed to members of the ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi and not to zygomycete fungi.</em></small><br>[ID: 21640313]"

Extracellular oxido-reductases and hydrolases from the fungus T. versicolor and fungal growth were monitored in liquid cultures in the presence of tetracycline, lincomycine, sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin for 10 days, in order to assess the suitability of these enzymes as biomarkers. Among the conditions of treatment, statistical analysis demonstrated an increase in manganese-dependent peroxidase after exposure to sulfadiazine at 1 mg/L when compared with the control. Acid phosphatase activity was decreased by lincomycine at 1 or 10 mg/L. Conversely, β-glucosidase activity increased in the presence of this antibiotic at 10 mg/L. In Terrestrial Model Ecosystems spiked with contaminated pig slurry, lincomycine at the concentration of 8 or 80 μg/kg dry soil, and ciprofloxacin at 250 ng/kg dry soil decreased the activity of soil dehydrogenase, when compared with a green slurry treatment, over 28-day incubations. Laccase activity was similarly decreased in the presence of the highest concentration of antibiotics. We determined bacterial and fungal biomasses using Q-PCR. Bacterial biomass was increased in the presence of lincomycine at 80 μg/kg whatever the time of exposure, and to a lesser extent in the presence of ciprofloxacin at 250 ng/kg, but only at day 28. In contrast, both antibiotics, whatever their concentrations, did not modify fungal biomass in soil. In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate important effects of antibiotics at concentrations found in the agricultural environment.</em></small><br>[ID: 21702076]"

Fernandez D, Tisserant E, Talhinhas P, Azinheira H, Vieira A, Petitot AS, Loureiro A, Poulain J, Da Silva C, Silva Mdo C, Duplessis S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Coffee (Coffea arabica L.), one of the key export and cash crops in tropical and subtropical countries, suffers severe losses from the rust fungus Hemileia vastatrix. The transcriptome of H. vastatrix was analysed during a compatible interaction with coffee to obtain an exhaustive repertoire of the genes expressed during infection and to identify potential effector genes. Large-scale sequencing (454-GS-FLEX Titanium) of mixed coffee and rust cDNAs obtained from 21-day rust-infected leaves generated 352 146 sequences which assembled into 22 774 contigs. In the absence of any reference genomic sequences for Coffea or Hemileia, specific trinucleotide frequencies within expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and blast homology against a set of dicots and basidiomycete genomes were used to distinguish pathogen from plant sequences. About 30% (6763) of the contigs were assigned to H. vastatrix and 61% (13 951) to C. arabica. The majority (60%) of the rust sequences did not show homology to any genomic database, indicating that they were potential novel fungal genes. In silico analyses of the 6763 H. vastatrix contigs predicted 382 secreted proteins and identified homologues of the flax rust haustorially expressed secreted proteins (HESPs) and bean rust transferred protein 1 (RTP1). These rust candidate effectors showed conserved amino-acid domains and conserved patterns of cysteine positions suggestive of conserved functions during infection of host plants. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction profiling of selected rust genes revealed dynamic expression patterns during the time course of infection of coffee leaves. This study provides the first valuable genomic resource for the agriculturally important plant pathogen H. vastatrix and the first comprehensive C. arabica EST dataset.</em></small><br>[ID: 21726390]"

To identify genes involved in this mycorrhiza-induced systemic resistance, we compared the leaf transcriptome of P. indica-colonized and noncolonized barley plants 12, 24, and 96 h after challenge with a virulent race of B. graminis. The leaf pathogen induced specific gene sets (e.g., LRR receptor kinases and WRKY transcription factors) at 12 h postinoculation (hpi) (prepenetration phase) and vesicle-localized gene products 24 hpi (haustorium establishment). Metabolic analysis revealed a progressing shift of steady state contents of the intermediates glucose-1-phosphate, uridinediphosphate-glucose, and phosphoenolpyruvate 24 and 96 hpi, indicating that B. graminis shifts central carbohydrate metabolism in favor of sucrose biosynthesis. Both B. graminis and P. indica increased glutamine and alanine contents, whereas substrates for starch and nitrogen assimilation (adenosinediphosphate- glucose and oxoglutarate) decreased. In plants that were more B. graminis resistant due to P. indica root colonization, 22 transcripts, including those of pathogenesis-related genes and genes encoding heat-shock proteins, were differentially expressed ?twofold in leaves after B. graminis inoculation compared with non-mycorrhized plants. Detailed expression analysis revealed a faster induction after B. graminis inoculation between 8 and 16 hpi, suggesting that priming of these genes is an important mechanism of P. indica-induced systemic disease resistance.</em></small><br>[ID: 21830949]"

Low molecular mass metabolites play a central role in the oxidative degradation of lignin. To understand the unique wood-decaying mechanism, we surveyed the oxidized derivatives of ceriporic acids (alk(en)ylitaconic acids) produced by C. subvermispora using high-resolution liquid chromatography multiple-stage mass spectrometry (HR-LC/MS(n)). The analysis of the precursor and product ions from the extract suggested that an epoxidized derivative of ceriporic acid is produced by the fungus. To identify the new metabolite, an authentic compound of ceriporic acid epoxide was synthesized in vitro by reacting (R)-3-[(Z)-hexadec-7-enyl]-itaconic acid (ceriporic acid C) with m-chloroperbenzoic acid. The precursor and product ions from the natural metabolite and authentic epoxide were identical and distinguishable from those of hydroxy and hydroperoxy derivatives after reduction with NaBD(4). Feeding experiments with [U-(13)C]-glucose, 99% and the subsequent analyses of the first and second generation product ions demonstrated that the oxidized ceriporic acid was (R)-3-(7,8-epoxy-hexadecyl)-itaconic acid.

While Car could be added into an organic phase (KF-96L-1CS, dimethyl silicone oil) at 50% (w/v), the accumulation of Car-Ox reached over 30g/l in spite of these strong microbial toxicities. Moreover, the epoxidation reaction smoothly proceeded in a novel L-L IBR system, a multistory L-L IBR systems, consisted of 5 stacked reactor units. The optical rotation of Car-Ox produced was (-) and the enantiomeric excesses of (-)-β-Car-Ox purified by 1st and 2nd recrystallization from methanol reached 97.51 and 99.33%, respectively.</em></small><br>[ID: 21890406]"

Ide M, Ichinose H, Wariishi H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We explored the molecular diversity and functional capabilities of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) from the brown-rot basidiomycete Postia placenta. Using bioinformatic and experimental data, we found 250 genes of P450s in the whole genome, including 60 putative allelic variants. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of 42 families, including 18 novel families. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of P450s from P. placenta and the white-rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium suggested that vigorous gene duplication and molecular evolution occurred after speciation of basidiomycetes. Among the 250 gene models, 184 were isolated as full-length cDNA and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae to construct a functional library in which recombinant P450s were co-expressed with yeast NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase. Using this library, the catalytic potentials of P450s against a wide variety of compounds were investigated. A functionomic survey allowed the discovery of novel catalytic properties of P. placenta P450s. The phylogenetic diversity of the CYP53 family in P. placenta was clear, and CYP53D2 is capable of converting stilbene derivatives. This is the first report of this peculiar function of the CYP53 family. Our increased understanding of the molecular and functional diversity of P450s in this fungus will facilitate comprehension of metabolic diversity in basidiomycetes and has future biotechnology applications.</em></small><br>[ID: 21938516]"

Nuutinen JT, Marttinen E, Soliymani R, Hildén K, Timonen S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Catabolism of amino acids is a central process in cellular nitrogen turnover, but only a few of the mechanisms involved have been described from basidiomycete fungi. This study identified one such mechanism, the l-amino acid oxidase (Lao1) enzyme of Hebeloma cylindrosporum, by 2D gel separation and MS. We determined genomic DNA sequences of lao1 and part of its upstream gene, a putative pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc2), and cloned the cDNA of lao1. The two genes were also identified and annotated from the genome of Laccaria bicolor. The lao1 and pdc2 gene structures were conserved between the two fungi. The intergenic region of L. bicolor possessed putative duplications not detected in H. cylindrosporum. Lao1 sequences possessed dinucleotide-binding motifs typical for flavoproteins. Lao1 was less than 23 % identical to Lao sequences described previously. Recombinant Lao1 of H. cylindrosporum was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and refolded with SDS to gain catalytic activity. The enzyme possessed broad substrate specificity: 37 l-amino acids or derivatives served as effective substrates. The highest activities were recorded with l-glutamate, but positively charged and aromatic amino acids were also accepted. Michaelis constants for six amino acids varied from 0.5 to 6.7 mM. We have thus characterized a novel type of Lao-enzyme and its gene from the basidiomycete fungus H. cylindrosporum.</em></small><br>[ID: 21998160]"

Li Z, Bi J, Yang J, Pan J, Sun Z, Zhu X<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungal laccases have been widely used in industry. The expression of laccase often is repressible by the primary carbon source glucose in many fungi. The underlying basis is largely unclear. We demonstrate here that a gene, TSP2-1, was required for laccase repression by glucose in the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans. TSP2-1 encodes a Tsp2-type tetraspanin. The disruption of TSP2-1 resulted in constant melanin formation and the expression of the laccase gene LAC1. This derepression phenotype was restorable by 10 mM exogenous cyclic AMP (cAMP). A capsule defect in the mutant tsp2-1Δ also was restored by cAMP. The results indicate an interaction of Tsp2-1 with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway that has been shown to modulate laccase repression and capsule biosynthesis in this fungus. Other roles of TSP2-1, e.g., in maintaining cell membrane integrity and stress resistance, also were defined. This work reveals a Tsp2-1-dependent glucose repression in C. neoformans.

Color changes observed when solutions of gum guiac, guiacol and syringaldzine were applied directly to mycelium grown on these media indicated that all isolates produced phenol oxidases. Sequences of ITS and LSU regions on the rDNA gene from 15 isolates were 99.2-100% identical, and analysis of sequence data with maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony suggest that the isolates from sugar beet roots are phylogenetically related to Athelia bombacina, Granulobasidium vellereum and Cyphella digitalis.

Arnerup J, Lind M, Olson Å, Stenlid J, Elfstrand M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] is one of the economically most important conifer species in Europe. The major pathogen on Norway spruce is Heterobasidion parviporum (Fr.) Niemelä & Korhonen. To achieve a better understanding of Norway spruce's defence mechanisms, transcriptional responses in bark to H. parviporum infection were compared with the response to wounding using cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism. The majority of the recovered transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) showed a similar expression pattern for infection and wounding treatment, although inoculated samples showed an enhanced reaction. Genes related to systemic acquired resistance, e.g., PR1, accumulated after H. parviporum infection. Simultaneously, several transcripts involved in various aspects of jasmonic acid (JA)- and ethylene (ET)-mediated signalling accumulated. Genes involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome system were also regulated. Expression patterns have been confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression patterns of the isolated TDFs suggest that infection with H. parviporum in Norway spruce induces a broad defence, with many similarities to non-specific defence responses in angiosperms. The parallel induction of salicylic acid- and JA/ET-mediated pathways implies spatially separated responses in different cell layers, with and without hyphal contact. A set of TDFs were analysed in an independent experiment with unrelated material treated with wounding or with inoculation with H. parviporum or Phlebiopsis gigantea, verifying the original observations and underlining the non-specific defence responses. In addition, our data suggest that rerouting of carbon in secondary metabolism is an integral part of Norway spruce induced defence. We report the sequences of three 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase genes (PaDAHP1, PaDAHP2 and PaDAHP3) and their relative expression in response to wounding and infection with H. parviporum and P. gigantea. The results clearly indicate differential regulation of the three DAHPs in the induced defence responses in Norway spruce. This study gives insights into the central mechanisms in the induced defences in Norway spruce.</em></small><br>[ID: 22084022]"

Qiang X, Weiss M, Kogel KH, Schäfer P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Piriformospora indica is a basidiomycete of the order Sebacinales, representing a model for the study of mutualistic symbiosis and, beyond that, the plant immune system. The fungus colonizes the roots of a wide range of vascular plants, increasing their growth, seed yield and adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses. The fungal colonization of roots begins with a biotrophic growth phase, in which living cells are colonized, and continues with a cell death-dependent phase, in which root cells are actively killed by the fungus. The complexity of sebacinalean symbiosis is further enhanced by the presence of endocellular bacteria which may represent significant determinants for a successful outcome of the symbioses. Molecular ecological analyses have revealed an exceptional relevance of sebacinoid fungi in natural ecosystems worldwide. This natural competence could be rooted in their phenotypic adaptability, which, for instance, allows P. indica to grow readily on various synthetic media and to colonize distinct hosts. In molecular and genetic studies, P. indica's mutualistic colonization strategy has been partly unravelled, showing that the jasmonate pathway is exploited for immune suppression and successful development in roots. Research on P. indica supports efforts to make the bioprotective potential of the fungus accessible for agricultural plant production. The decoding of P. indica's genome has revealed its potential for application as bioagent and for targeted improvement of crop plants in biotechnology-based approaches.</em></small><br>[ID: 22111580]"

In the absence of effective immune containment, the initial pulmonary infection often spreads to the central nervous system to result in meningoencephalitis. The fungus must therefore make the transition from the environment to different mammalian niches that include the intracellular locale of phagocytic cells and extracellular sites in the lung, bloodstream, and central nervous system. Recent studies provide insights into mechanisms of adaptation during this transition that include the expression of antiphagocytic functions, the remodeling of central carbon metabolism, the expression of specific nutrient acquisition systems, and the response to hypoxia. Specific transcription factors regulate these functions as well as the expression of one or more of the major known virulence factors of C. neoformans. Therefore, virulence factor expression is to a large extent embedded in the regulation of a variety of functions needed for growth in mammalian hosts. In this regard, the complex integration of these processes is reminiscent of the master regulators of virulence in bacterial pathogens.</em></small><br>[ID: 22140231]"

A discrete modeling approach enables the underlying mechanistic rule concerning the basic architecture and dynamics of fungal networks to be studied on the scale of a single colony. By comparing simulations of the FGM with laboratory experiments of fungal colonies growing on malt extract agar we show that the combined effects of water activity, temperature and pH on the radial growth rate of fungal mycelia on the macroscopic scale may be explained by a power law for the costs of hyphal maintenance and expansion on the microscopic scale. Information about the response of the fungal mycelium at the micro- scopic level to environmental conditions is essential for simulating its behavior in complex structure substrates such as wood, where the effect of the fungus on the wood (i.e. the degradation of the cell wall) changes the local environmental condition (e.g. the permeability of the substrate and therefore the water activity in a colonized wood cell lumen). Using a combination of diffusion and moisture processes with the FGM may increase our understanding of the colonization strategy of P. vitreus and help to optimize its growth behavior for biotechnological applications such as bioincising.</em></small><br>[ID: 22144072]"

Samuels GJ, Ismaiel A, Rosmana A, Junaid M, Guest D, McMahon P, Keane P, Purwantara A, Lambert S, Rodriguez-Carres M, Cubeta MA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Vascular Streak Dieback (VSD) disease of cacao (Theobroma cacao) in Southeast Asia and Melanesia is caused by a basidiomycete (Ceratobasidiales) fungus Oncobasidium theobromae (syn. =Thanatephorus theobromae). The most characteristic symptoms of the disease are green-spotted leaf chlorosis or, commonly since about 2004, necrotic blotches, followed by senescence of leaves beginning on the second or third flush behind the shoot apex, and blackening of infected xylem in the vascular traces at the leaf scars resulting from the abscission of infected leaves. Eventually the shoot apex is killed and infected branches die. In susceptible cacao the fungus may grow through the xylem down into the main stem and kill a mature cacao tree. Infections in the stem of young plants prior to the formation of the first 3-4 lateral branches usually kill the plant. Basidiospores released from corticioid basidiomata developed on leaf scars or along cracks in the main vein of infected leaves infect young leaves. The pathogen commonly infects cacao but there are rare reports from avocado. As both crops are introduced to the region, the pathogen is suspected to occur asymptomatically in native vegetation. The pathogen is readily isolated but cultures cannot be maintained. In this study, DNA was extracted from pure cultures of O. theobromae obtained from infected cacao plants sampled from Indonesia. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), consisting of ITS1, 5.8S ribosomal RNA and ITS2, and a portion of nuclear large subunit (LSU) were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences placed O. theobromae sister to Ceratobasidium anastomosis groups AG-A, AG-Bo, and AG-K with high posterior probability. Therefore the new combination Ceratobasidium theobromae is proposed. A PCR-based protocol was developed to detect and identify C. theobromae in plant tissue of cacao enabling early detection of the pathogen in plants. A second species of Ceratobasidium, Ceratobasidium ramicola, identified through ITS sequence analysis, was isolated from VSD-affected cacao plants in Java, and is widespread in diseased cacao collected from Indonesia.</em></small><br>[ID: 22208598]"

Okamoto K, Kanawaku R, Masumoto M, Yanase H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The efficient production of bioethanol on an industrial scale requires the use of renewable lignocellulosic biomass as a starting material. A limiting factor in developing efficient processes is identifying microorganisms that are able to effectively ferment xylose, the major pentose sugar found in hemicellulose, and break down carbohydrate polymers without pre-treatment steps. Here, a basidiomycete brown rot fungus was isolated as a new biocatalyst with unprecedented fermentability, as it was capable of converting not only the 6-carbon sugars constituting cellulose, but also the major 5-carbon sugar xylose in hemicelluloses, to ethanol. The fungus was identified as Neolentinus lepideus and was capable of assimilating and fermenting xylose to ethanol in yields of 0.30, 0.33, and 0.34 g of ethanol per g of xylose consumed under aerobic, oxygen-limited, and anaerobic conditions, respectively. A small amount of xylitol was detected as the major by-product of xylose metabolism. N. lepideus produced ethanol from glucose, mannose, galactose, cellobiose, maltose, and lactose with yields ranging from 0.34 to 0.38 g ethanol per g sugar consumed, and also exhibited relatively favorable conversion of non-pretreated starch, xylan, and wheat bran. These results suggest that N. lepideus is a promising candidate for cost-effective and environmentally friendly ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. To our knowledge, this is the first report on efficient ethanol fermentation from various carbohydrates, including xylose, by a naturally occurring brown rot fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 22226194]"

Deflorio G, Horgan G, Jaspars M, Woodward S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Metabolite fingerprinting of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) bark and sapwood was carried out by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance after wounding and artificial inoculation with the white rot fungus Heterobasidion annosum sensu stricto. The aim was to determine whether metabolites would differ in clones showing differing levels of susceptibility to H. annosum, in the fungal as compared with the control treatment (wounding, no fungus) and the reference (healthy sample collected at 0 days), at two different locations on the host, and at different sampling times (3 and 43 days after treatment). The results suggested that different metabolic processes occur in bark and sapwood after wounding and fungal inoculation, compared with healthy samples collected before treatment: In bark, greater peaks were elicited in the aromatic region whereas, in sapwood, lower amounts of all metabolites were observed in inoculated samples, compared with healthy samples. Multivariate statistical analysis carried out with analysis of variance-principal component analysis showed highly significant effects of reference, location, and time (PC1), and significant effects of clone and fungus. Differences between clones were apparent in sapwood but not in bark and were due to peaks in the aliphatic and carbohydrate regions. Over time, in bark, there was a decrease in carbohydrate peaks, followed by an increase in aliphatic and aromatic peaks. Sapwood, by contrast, showed a decrease in all peaks, followed by an increase in carbohydrate and aliphatic peaks. Changes in carbohydrate levels were observed within the lesion compared with the more distal location in both bark and sapwood.</em></small><br>[ID: 22227827]"

Hernández-Ortega A, Ferreira P, Martínez AT<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Aryl-alcohol oxidase (AAO) is an extracellular flavoprotein providing the H(2)O(2) required by ligninolytic peroxidases for fungal degradation of lignin, the key step for carbon recycling in land ecosystems. O(2) activation by Pleurotus eryngii AAO takes place during the redox-cycling of p-methoxylated benzylic metabolites secreted by the fungus. Only Pleurotus AAO sequences were available for years, but the number strongly increased recently due to sequencing of different basidiomycete genomes, and a comparison of 112 GMC (glucose-methanol-choline oxidase) superfamily sequences including 40 AAOs is presented. As shown by kinetic isotope effects, alcohol oxidation by AAO is produced by hydride transfer to the flavin, and hydroxyl proton transfer to a base. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that His502 activates the alcohol substrate by proton abstraction, and this result was extended to other GMC oxidoreductases where the nature of the base was under discussion. However, in contrast with that proposed for GMC oxidoreductases, the two transfers are not stepwise but concerted. Alcohol docking at the buried AAO active site resulted in only one catalytically relevant position for concerted transfer, with the pro-R α-hydrogen at distance for hydride abstraction. The expected hydride-transfer stereoselectivity was demonstrated, for the first time in a GMC oxidoreductase, by using the (R) and (S) enantiomers of α-deuterated p-methoxybenzyl alcohol. Other largely unexplained aspects of AAO catalysis (such as the unexpected specificity on substituted aldehydes) can also be explained in the light of the recent results. Finally, the biotechnological interest of AAO in flavor production is extended by its potential in production of chiral compounds taking advantage from the above-described stereoselectivity.</em></small><br>[ID: 22249717]"

At least three distinct phenomena can occur, being modulated by the environmental conditions: (1) when the pH increases or in the presence of Ca(2+) ions, an assembled state, β-sheet rich, is formed; (2) when the solvent polarity increases, the protein shows an increased tendency to reach hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces, with no detectable conformational change; and (3) when a reversible conformational change and reversible aggregation occur at high temperature. Modulation of the Vmh2 conformational/aggregation features by changing the environmental conditions can be very useful in view of the potential protein applications.</em></small><br>[ID: 22292968]"

It owes its destructiveness to a uniquely well-developed capacity to colonize by rapid mycelial spread from sites of initial spore infection, coupled with aggressive degradation of wood cellulose. Genomic methods have recently elucidated the evolution and enzymic repertoire of the fungus, suggesting that it has a distinctive mode of brown rot wood decay. Using novel methods to image nutrient translocation, its mycelium has been modeled as a highly responsive resource-supply network. Dry rot is preventable by keeping timber dry.

Raffaello T, Keriö S, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. s.l. is a filamentous white rot fungus, considered to be the most economically important pathogen of conifer trees. Despite the severity of the tree infection, very little is known about the molecular and biochemical aspects related to adaptation to abiotic stresses. In this study, the osmotic and oxidative tolerance as well as the role of the HaHOG1 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) gene were investigated. The transcript levels of the yeast orthologues GPD1, HSP78, STL1, GRE2 and the ATPase pumps ENA1, PMR1, PMC1 known to have an important role in osmotolerance were also quantified under salt osmotic conditions. The HaHOG1 gene was used for a heterologous expression and functional study in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Δhog1 strain. Moreover, the phosphorylation level of HaHog1p was studied under salt osmotic and oxidative stress. The result showed that H. annosum displayed a decreased growth when exposed to an increased concentration of osmotic and oxidative stressors. GPD1, HSP78, STL1 and GRE2 showed an induction already at 10 min after exposure to salt stress. Among the ATPase pumps studied, PMC1 was highly induced when the fungus was exposed to 0.2 M CaCl₂ for 60 min. The heterologous expression of the HaHOG1 sequence in yeast confirmed that the gene is able to restore the osmotolerance and oxidative tolerance in the S. cerevisiae hog1Δ mutant strain. The HaHog1p was strongly phosphorylated in the presence of NaCl, KCl, H₂O₂ but not in the presence of CaCl₂ and MgCl₂. The GFP-HaHog1p fusion protein accumulated in the nuclei of the S. cerevisiae hog1Δ cells when exposed to high osmotic conditions but not under oxidative stress. These results provide the first insights about the response of H. annosum to osmotic and oxidative stress and elucidate the role of the HaHOG1 gene in such conditions.</em></small><br>[ID: 22319614]"

Thomas E, Pakala S, Fedorova ND, Nierman WC, Cubeta MA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The aneuploid and heterokaryotic nuclear condition of the soil fungus Rhizoctonia solani have provided challenges in obtaining a complete genome sequence. To better aid in the assembly and annotation process, a protoplast and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based method was developed to identify regenerated protoplasts with a reduced nuclear genome. Protocol optimization experiments showed that enzymatic digestion of mycelium from a 24 h culture of R. solani increased the proportion of protoplasts with a diameter of ≤7.5 μm and 1-4 nuclei. To determine whether strains regenerated from protoplasts with a reduced number of nuclei were genetically different from the parental strain, triallelic SNPs identified from variance records of the genomic DNA sequence reads of R. solani were used in PCR-based genotyping assays. Results from 16 of the 24 SNP-based PCR assays provided evidence that one of the three alleles was missing in the 11 regenerated protoplast strains, suggesting that these strains represent a reduced genomic complement of the parental strain. The protoplast and triallelic SNP-based method used in this study may be useful in strain development and analysis of other basidiomycete fungi with complex nuclear genomes.</em></small><br>[ID: 22321572]"

We are studying the ortholog of Ace1 from fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium PcACE1, isolated by complementation in yeast. In this report we show the localization of the transactivation region of PcACE1. Different PcACE1 fragments were ligated in frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain by site-directed mutagenesis in a suitable yeast expression vector. Transformation of an appropriate Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was used as host. This strain contains the fusion GAL1:lacZ in its genome under the control of promoter sequences recognized by GAL4. Finally, we measured â-galactosidase activity in each yeast clone. The activation of the reporter gene is proportional to the transactivation capacity of the transcription factor PcACE1. The results obtained indicate that PcACE1 transactivation domain is located in the carboxy terminal half and contains an array of cysteines in the form of Cys-X-Cys and Cys-X2-Cys and a 60% of Ser. Therefore, these results show that this type of Cys motif can function as transcription activating domain not only in transcription factors that respond to minimal copper concentrations but also in those that respond to high copper concentrations.

Global gene expression studies in barley identified various ethylene synthesis and signaling components that were differentially regulated in P. indica-colonized roots. Based on these findings we examined the impact of ethylene in the symbiotic association. The data presented here suggest that P. indica induces ethylene synthesis in barley and Arabidopsis roots during colonization.

Costa GG, Cabrera OG, Tiburcio RA, Medrano FJ, Carazzolle MF, Thomazella DP, Schuster SC, Carlson JE, Guiltinan MJ, Bailey BA, Mieczkowski P, Pereira GA, Meinhardt LW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In this study, we report the sequence of the mitochondrial (mt) genome of the Basidiomycete fungus Moniliophthora roreri, which is the etiologic agent of frosty pod rot of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.). We also compare it to the mtDNA from the closely-related species Moniliophthora perniciosa, which causes witches' broom disease of cacao. The 94 Kb mtDNA genome of M. roreri has a circular topology and codes for the typical 14 mt genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. It also codes for both rRNA genes, a ribosomal protein subunit, 13 intronic open reading frames (ORFs), and a full complement of 27 tRNA genes. The conserved genes of M. roreri mtDNA are completely syntenic with homologous genes of the 109 Kb mtDNA of M. perniciosa. As in M. perniciosa, M. roreri mtDNA contains a high number of hypothetical ORFs (28), a remarkable feature that make Moniliophthoras the largest reservoir of hypothetical ORFs among sequenced fungal mtDNA. Additionally, the mt genome of M. roreri has three free invertron-like linear mt plasmids, one of which is very similar to that previously described as integrated into the main M. perniciosa mtDNA molecule. Moniliophthora roreri mtDNA also has a region of suspected plasmid origin containing 15 hypothetical ORFs distributed in both strands. One of these ORFs is similar to an ORF in the mtDNA gene encoding DNA polymerase in Pleurotus ostreatus. The comparison to M. perniciosa showed that the 15 Kb difference in mtDNA sizes is mainly attributed to a lower abundance of repetitive regions in M. roreri (5.8 Kb vs 20.7 Kb). The most notable differences between M. roreri and M. perniciosa mtDNA are attributed to repeats and regions of plasmid origin. These elements might have contributed to the rapid evolution of mtDNA. Since M. roreri is the second species of the genus Moniliophthora whose mtDNA genome has been sequenced, the data presented here contribute valuable information for understanding the evolution of fungal mt genomes among closely-related species.</em></small><br>[ID: 22559916]"

Infected trees combat the lateral spread of decay by bordering the heartwood with a fungistatic reaction zone characterized by elevated pH and phenol content. To examine the mode of fungal feeding in the reaction zone of mature Norway spruce trees naturally infected by H. parviporum, we conducted spatial profiling of pectin and hemicellulose composition, and established transcript levels of candidate fungal genes encoding enzymes involved in degradation of the different cell wall components of wood. Colonized inner heartwood showed pectin and hemicellulose concentrations similar to those of healthy heartwood, whereas the carbohydrate profiles of compromised reaction zone, irrespective of the age of fungal activity in the tissue, indicated selective fungal utilization of galacturonic acid, arabinose, xylose and mannose. These data show that the rate of wood decay in the reaction zone is slow. While the up-regulation of genes encoding pectinases and hemicellulases preceded that of the endoglucanase gene during an early phase of fungal interaction with xylem defense, the manganese peroxidase gene showed similar transcript levels during different phases of wood colonization.

Vohník M, Sadowsky JJ, Kohout P, Lhotáková Z, Nestby R, Kolařík M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ericaceae (the heath family) are widely distributed calcifuges inhabiting soils with inherently poor nutrient status. Ericaceae overcome nutrient limitation through symbiosis with ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) fungi that mobilize nutrients complexed in recalcitrant organic matter. At present, recognized ErM fungi include a narrow taxonomic range within the Ascomycota, and the Sebacinales, basal Hymenomycetes with unclamped hyphae and imperforate parenthesomes. Here we describe a novel type of basidiomycetous ErM symbiosis, termed 'sheathed ericoid mycorrhiza', discovered in two habitats in mid-Norway as a co-dominant mycorrhizal symbiosis in Vaccinium spp. The basidiomycete forming sheathed ErM possesses clamped hyphae with perforate parenthesomes, produces 1- to 3-layer sheaths around terminal parts of hair roots and colonizes their rhizodermis intracellularly forming hyphal coils typical for ErM symbiosis. Two basidiomycetous isolates were obtained from sheathed ErM and molecular and phylogenetic tools were used to determine their identity; they were also examined for the ability to form sheathed ErM and lignocellulolytic potential. Surprisingly, ITS rDNA of both conspecific isolates failed to amplify with the most commonly used primer pairs, including ITS1 and ITS1F + ITS4. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear LSU, SSU and 5.8S rDNA indicates that the basidiomycete occupies a long branch residing in the proximity of Trechisporales and Hymenochaetales, but lacks a clear sequence relationship (>90% similarity) to fungi currently placed in these orders. The basidiomycete formed the characteristic sheathed ErM symbiosis and enhanced growth of Vaccinium spp. in vitro, and degraded a recalcitrant aromatic substrate that was left unaltered by common ErM ascomycetes. Our findings provide coherent evidence that this hitherto undescribed basidiomycete forms a morphologically distinct ErM symbiosis that may occur at significant levels under natural conditions, yet remain undetected when subject to amplification by 'universal' primers. The lignocellulolytic assay suggests the basidiomycete may confer host adaptations distinct from those provisioned by the so far investigated ascomycetous ErM fungi.</em></small><br>[ID: 22761814]"

The ability of the fungus to sense its environment is critical for proliferation and the generation of infectious propagules, as well as for adaptation to the mammalian host during infection.

These phenotypes include loss of the ability to mate and to elaborate the key virulence factors capsule and melanin.

Fujikawa T, Sakaguchi A, Nishizawa Y, Kouzai Y, Minami E, Yano S, Koga H, Meshi T, Nishimura M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Plants evoke innate immunity against microbial challenges upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as fungal cell wall chitin. Nevertheless, pathogens may circumvent the host PAMP-triggered immunity. We previously reported that the ascomycete Magnaporthe oryzae, a famine-causing rice pathogen, masks cell wall surfaces with α-1,3-glucan during invasion. Here, we show that the surface α-1,3-glucan is indispensable for the successful infection of the fungus by interfering with the plant's defense mechanisms. The α-1,3-glucan synthase gene MgAGS1 was not essential for infectious structure development but was required for infection in M. oryzae. Lack or degradation of surface α-1,3-glucan increased fungal susceptibility towards chitinase, suggesting the protective role of α-1,3-glucan against plants' antifungal enzymes during infection. Furthermore, rice plants secreting bacterial α-1,3-glucanase (AGL-rice) showed strong resistance not only to M. oryzae but also to the phylogenetically distant ascomycete Cochlioborus miyabeanus and the polyphagous basidiomycete Rhizoctonia solani; the histocytochemical analysis of the latter two revealed that α-1,3-glucan also concealed cell wall chitin in an infection-specific manner. Treatment with α-1,3-glucanase in vitro caused fragmentation of infectious hyphae in R. solani but not in M. oryzae or C. miyabeanus, indicating that α-1,3-glucan is also involved in maintaining infectious structures in some fungi. Importantly, rapid defense responses were evoked (a few hours after inoculation) in the AGL-rice inoculated with M. oryzae, C. miyabeanus and R. solani as well as in non-transgenic rice inoculated with the ags1 mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that α-1,3-glucan protected the fungal cell wall from degradative enzymes secreted by plants even from the pre-penetration stage and interfered with the release of PAMPs to delay innate immune defense responses. Because α-1,3-glucan is nondegradable in plants, it is reasonable that many fungal plant pathogens utilize α-1,3-glucan in the innate immune evasion mechanism and some in maintaining the structures.</em></small><br>[ID: 22927818]"

Heinzelmann R, Rigling D, Prospero S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Armillaria cepistipes is a common wood-rotting basidiomycete fungus found in most forests in Central Europe. In Switzerland, the habitat of A. cepistipes is fragmented because of the presence of major geographical barriers, in particular the Alps, and past deforestation. We analysed the impact of habitat fragmentation on the current spatial genetic structure of the Swiss A. cepistipes population. A total of 167 isolates were sampled across an area of 41 000 km(2) and genotyped at seven microsatellite and four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. All isolates belonged to different genotypes which, according to the Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in Tess, originated from a single gene pool. Our analyses indicate that the overall A. cepistipes population shows little, but significant (F(ST)=0.02), genetic differentiation. Such a situation suggests gene flow is strong, possibly due to long-distance dispersal of airborne basidiospores. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that we could not detect a pattern of isolation by distance. Gene flow is partially restricted by the high mountain ranges of the Alps, as indicated by a signal of spatial autocorrelation detected among genotypes separated by less than about 80-130 km. In contrast, past deforestation seems to have no significant effect on the current spatial population structure of A. cepistipes. This might indicate the existence of a time lag between the current spatial genetic structure and the processes that have induced this specific structure.</em></small><br>[ID: 22954341]"

The Heterobasidion population at the sample plot was screened for mycoviruses prior to and after the inoculation.

In plants, one of the main sources of methanol is the pectin present in the structure of cell walls. Pectin is composed of highly methylesterified chains of galacturonic acid. The hydrolysis between the methyl radicals and galacturonic acid in esterified pectin, mediated by a pectin methylesterase (PME), releases methanol, which may be decomposed by a methanol oxidase (MOX). The analysis of the M. pernciosa genome revealed putative mox and pme genes. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR performed with RNA from mycelia grown in the presence of methanol or pectin as the sole carbon source and with RNA from infected cacao seedlings in different stages of the progression of WBD indicate that the two genes are coregulated, suggesting that the fungus may be metabolizing the methanol released from pectin. Moreover, immunolocalization of homogalacturonan, the main pectic domain that constitutes the primary cell wall matrix, shows a reduction in the level of pectin methyl esterification in infected cacao seedlings. Although MOX has been classically classified as a peroxisomal enzyme, M. perniciosa presents an extracellular methanol oxidase. Its activity was detected in the fungus culture supernatants, and mass spectrometry analysis indicated the presence of this enzyme in the fungus secretome. Because M. pernciosa possesses all genes classically related to methanol metabolism, we propose a peroxisome-independent model for the utilization of methanol by this fungus, which begins with the extracellular oxidation of methanol derived from the demethylation of pectin and finishes in the cytosol.</em></small><br>[ID: 23022488]"

Nagy NE, Kvaalen H, Fongen M, Fossdal CG, Clarke N, Solheim H, Hietala AM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Pathogen challenge of tree sapwood induces the formation of reaction zones with antimicrobial properties such as elevated pH and cation content. Many fungi lower substrate pH by secreting oxalic acid, its conjugate base oxalate being a reductant as well as a chelating agent for cations. To examine the role of oxalic acid in pathogenicity of white-rot fungi, we conducted spatial quantification of oxalate, transcript levels of related fungal genes, and element concentrations in heartwood of Norway spruce challenged naturally by Heterobasidion parviporum. In the pathogen-compromised reaction zone, upregulation of an oxaloacetase gene generating oxalic acid coincided with oxalate and cation accumulation and presence of calcium oxalate crystals. The colonized inner heartwood showed trace amounts of oxalate. Moreover, fungal exposure to the reaction zone under laboratory conditions induced oxaloacetase and oxalate accumulation, whereas heartwood induced a decarboxylase gene involved in degradation of oxalate. The excess level of cations in defense xylem inactivates pathogen-secreted oxalate through precipitation and, presumably, only after cation neutralization can oxalic acid participate in lignocellulose degradation. This necessitates enhanced production of oxalic acid by H. parviporum. This study is the first to determine the true influence of white-rot fungi on oxalate crystal formation in tree xylem.</em></small><br>[ID: 23035954]"

The laccase was highly ethanol resistant, with 80% of its original activity was detected when incubated in 25% ethanol for 14 days. Furthermore, crude enzyme broth or Lcc3 could degrade lignin in kraft paper (26.5%), and showed high decoloration efficiency (90%) on synthetic dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R. Together, these data demonstrate that Cerrena sp. WR1 Lcc3 possesses novel biochemical and kinetic properties that may aid its application in industry.</em></small><br>[ID: 23081836]"

Franken P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The successful conversion of plant production systems from conventional resource-exhausting to sustainable strategies depends on knowledge-based management of environmental factors. Root-inhabiting fungi came more and more into focus because their hyphae connect in ideal manner resources and challenges of the surrounding with the plant. A paradigm for such root endophytes is presented by the basidiomycete Piriformospora indica. This fungus possesses a broad host spectrum and positively affects different aspects of plant performance. This so far unique combination of attributes makes P. indica and its close relatives among the Sebacinales very interesting tools for cultivation of various crops. This review will outline the different aspects required to apply this root endophyte in agri- and horticulture concerning plant growth, plant nutrition and plant defence or tolerance thereby explaining what is known about the biological basis for the observed effects. Open questions and challenges for successful inoculum production and application will be discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 23108570]"

Hunt CG, Houtman CJ, Jones DC, Kitin P, Korripally P, Hammel KE<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Oxidative cleavage of the recalcitrant plant polymer lignin is a crucial step in global carbon cycling, and is accomplished most efficiently by fungi that cause white rot of wood. These basidiomycetes secrete many enzymes and metabolites with proposed ligninolytic roles, and it is not clear whether all of these agents are physiologically important during attack on natural lignocellulosic substrates. One new approach to this problem is to infer properties of ligninolytic oxidants from their spatial distribution relative to the fungus on the lignocellulose. We grew Phanerochaete chrysosporium on wood sections in the presence of oxidant-sensing beads based on the ratiometric fluorescent dye BODIPY 581/591. The beads, having fixed locations relative to the fungal hyphae, enabled spatial mapping of cumulative extracellular oxidant distributions by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that oxidation gradients occurred around the hyphae, and data analysis using a mathematical reaction-diffusion model indicated that the dominant oxidant during incipient white rot had a half-life under 0.1 s. The best available hypothesis is that this oxidant is the cation radical of the secreted P. chrysosporium metabolite veratryl alcohol.</em></small><br>[ID: 23206186]"

Arnerup J, Nemesio-Gorriz M, Lundén K, Asiegbu FO, Stenlid J, Elfstrand M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A key tree species for the forest industry in Europe is Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.]. One of its major diseases is stem and butt rot caused by Heterobasidion parviporum (Fr.) Niemelä & Korhonen, which causes extensive revenue losses every year. In this study, we investigated the parallel induction of Norway spruce genes presumably associated with salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid/ethylene-mediated signalling pathways previously observed in response to H. parviporum. Relative gene expression levels in bark samples of genes involved in the salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid/ethylene-mediated signalling pathways after wounding and inoculation with either the saprotrophic biocontrol fungus Phlebiopsis gigantea or with H. parviporum were analysed with quantitative PCR at the site of the wound and at two distal locations from the wound/inoculation site to evaluate their roles in the induced defence response to H. parviporum in Norway spruce. Treatment of Norway spruce seedlings with methylsalicylate, methyljasmonate and inhibitors of the jasmonic acid/ethylene signalling pathway, as well as the Phenylalanine ammonia lyase inhibitor 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid were conducted to determine the responsiveness of genes characteristic of the different pathways to different hormonal stimuli. The data suggest that jasmonic acid-mediated signalling plays a central role in the induction of the genes analysed in this study irrespective of their responsiveness to salicylic acid. This may suggest that jasmonic acid-mediated signalling is the prioritized module in the Norway spruce defence signalling network against H. parviporum and that there seems to be no immediate antagonism between the modules in this interaction.</em></small><br>[ID: 23223898]"

However, production of mature fruiting bodies of this species under artificially controlled conditions has not been reported until now. Here, we provide the first report of successful initiation and development of L. sulphureus fruiting bodies in large-scale experiments. Twelve Laetiporus strains were isolated from a natural habitat. A synthetic log production system with a substrate composed of a mixture of sawdust enriched with organic and inorganic additives was developed. It was found that shocking the fungus mycelium with cold water or low temperature was the only suitable method for forced fruiting of L. sulphureus strains. Primordia of two strains were initiated already after 5-6 days from induction, and after another 2 days, they began to develop into fruiting bodies. Carpophores appeared fastest on substrates with high organic supplementation (40-45 %) and a low moisture content (40 %). The resulting mature fruiting bodies reached a weight of 200-300 g. The method of cultivation presented in this paper opens the way to commercial production of this valuable basidiomycete.</em></small><br>[ID: 23229287]"

Here, H. irregulare was grown on biomass, and the most abundant protein in the culture filtrate was identified as the only family 7 glycoside hydrolase in the genome, which consists of a single catalytic domain, lacking a linker and carbohydrate-binding module. The enzyme, HirCel7A, was characterized biochemically to determine the optimal conditions for activity. HirCel7A was crystallized and the structure, refined at 1.7 Å resolution, confirms that HirCel7A is a cellobiohydrolase rather than an endoglucanase, with a cellulose-binding tunnel that is more closed than Phanerochaete chrysosporium Cel7D and more open than Hypocrea jecorina Cel7A, suggesting intermediate enzyme properties. Molecular simulations were conducted to ascertain differences in enzyme-ligand interactions, ligand solvation, and loop flexibility between the family 7 glycoside hydrolase cellobiohydrolases from H. irregulare, H. jecorina, and P. chrysosporium. The structural comparisons and simulations suggest significant differences in enzyme-ligand interactions at the tunnel entrance in the -7 to -4 binding sites and suggest that a tyrosine residue at the tunnel entrance of HirCel7A may serve as an additional ligand-binding site. Additionally, the loops over the active site in H. jecorina Cel7A are more closed than loops in the other two enzymes, which has implications for the degree of processivity, endo-initiation, and substrate dissociation. Overall, this study highlights molecular level features important to understanding this biologically and industrially important family of glycoside hydrolases.</em></small><br>[ID: 23303184]"

According to extracellular activities, production of both lignin peroxidase (LiP) and MnP was significantly promoted with wood as carbon source, with milled alder (MA) and low nitrogen (LN) resulting with the maximal LiP activities (550 nkat l(-1)) and noticeable levels of MnP (3 μkat l(-1)).

Maximal laccase activities (22 and 29 μkat l(-1)) were obtained in extra high nitrogen (eHN) containing defined and complex media supplemented with 1.5 mM Cu(2+). However, the nitrogen source, either peptone or ammonium nitrate and asparagine, caused no stimulation on laccase production without Cu-supplement.

To investigate the evolutionary and demographic history of the lichenicolous fungus and its hosts, we used coalescent samplers to generate trees, and Bayesian skyline plots. We found that the hosts were most important in structuring populations of the lichenicolous species. Despite their wide geographic distribution, the same haplotypes of T. lobariacearum consistently associated with a given host species. Our results suggest that the Lobaria hosts create a selective environment for the lichenicolous fungus. Both the pathogen and the host populations exhibited substantial genetic structure.

Harrach BD, Baltruschat H, Barna B, Fodor J, Kogel KH<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fusarium culmorum causes root rot in barley (Hordeum vulgare), resulting in severely reduced plant growth and yield. Pretreatment of roots with chlamydospores of the mutualistic root-colonizing basidiomycete Piriformospora indica (subdivision Agaricomycotina) prevented necrotization of root tissues and plant growth retardation commonly associated with Fusarium root rot. Quantification of Fusarium infections with a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay revealed a correlation between root rot symptoms and the relative amount of fungal DNA. Fusarium-infected roots showed reduced levels of ascorbate and glutathione (GSH), along with reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, GSH reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase. Consistent with this, Fusarium-infected roots showed elevated levels of lipid hydroperoxides and decreased ratios of reduced to oxidized forms of ascorbate and GSH. In clear contrast, roots treated with P. indica prior to inoculation with F. culmorum showed levels of ascorbate and GSH that were similar to controls. Likewise, lipid peroxidation and the overall reduction in antioxidant enzyme activities were largely attenuated by P. indica in roots challenged by F. culmorum. These results suggest that P. indica protects roots from necrotrophic pathogens, at least partly, through activating the plant's antioxidant capacity.</em></small><br>[ID: 23405867]"

Bacci M Jr, Bueno OC, Rodrigues A, Pagnocca FC, Somera AF, Silva A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Mutualistic associations shape the evolution in different organism groups. The association between the leaf-cutter ant Atta sexdens and the basidiomycete fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus has enabled them to degrade starch from plant material generating glucose, which is a major food source for both mutualists. Starch degradation is promoted by enzymes contained in the fecal fluid that ants deposit on the fungus culture in cut leaves inside the nests. To understand the dynamics of starch degradation in ant nests, we purified and characterized starch degrading enzymes from the ant fecal fluid and from laboratory cultures of L. gongylophorus and found that the ants intestine positively selects fungal α-amylase and a maltase likely produced by the ants, as a negative selection is imposed to fungal maltase and ant α-amylases. Selected enzymes are more resistant to catabolic repression by glucose and proposed to structure a metabolic pathway in which the fungal α-amylase initiates starch catalysis to generate byproducts which are sequentially degraded by the maltase to produce glucose. The pathway is responsible for effective degradation of starch and proposed to represent a major evolutionary innovation enabling efficient starch assimilation from plant material by leaf-cutters.</em></small><br>[ID: 23500892]"

MI-S was given either topically or by oral gavage under various pre- and posttreatment regimens, and the severity of disease and viral titers in ocular and vaginal samples were determined. No toxicity was observed in the uninfected groups treated with MI-S. The topical and oral treatments with MI-S were not effective in reducing ocular disease. Topical application of MI-S on skin lesions was also not effective, but cutaneously infected mice treated orally with MI-S had significantly reduced disease scores (P < 0.05) after day 9, suggesting that healing was accelerated. Vaginal administration of MI-S 20 min before viral challenge reduced the mean disease scores on days 5 to 9 (P < 0.05), viral titers on day 1 (P < 0.05), and mortality (P < 0.0001) in comparison to the control groups (untreated and vehicle treated). These results show that MI-S may be useful as an oral agent to reduce the severity of HSV cutaneous and mucosal lesions and, more importantly, as a microbicide to block sexual transmission of HSV-2 genital infections.</em></small><br>[ID: 23507287]"

Wu M, Beckham GT, Larsson AM, Ishida T, Kim S, Payne CM, Himmel ME, Crowley MF, Horn SJ, Westereng B, Igarashi K, Samejima M, Ståhlberg J, Eijsink VG, Sandgren M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Carbohydrate structures are modified and degraded in the biosphere by a myriad of mostly hydrolytic enzymes. Recently, lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases (LPMOs) were discovered as a new class of enzymes for cleavage of recalcitrant polysaccharides that instead employ an oxidative mechanism. LPMOs employ copper as the catalytic metal and are dependent on oxygen and reducing agents for activity. LPMOs are found in many fungi and bacteria, but to date no basidiomycete LPMO has been structurally characterized. Here we present the three-dimensional crystal structure of the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium GH61D LPMO, and, for the first time, measure the product distribution of LPMO action on a lignocellulosic substrate. The structure reveals a copper-bound active site common to LPMOs, a collection of aromatic and polar residues near the binding surface that may be responsible for regio-selectivity, and substantial differences in loop structures near the binding face compared with other LPMO structures. The activity assays indicate that this LPMO primarily produces aldonic acids. Last, molecular simulations reveal conformational changes, including the binding of several regions to the cellulose surface, leading to alignment of three tyrosine residues on the binding face of the enzyme with individual cellulose chains, similar to what has been observed for family 1 carbohydrate-binding modules. A calculated potential energy surface for surface translation indicates that P. chrysosporium GH61D exhibits energy wells whose spacing seems adapted to the spacing of cellobiose units along a cellulose chain.</em></small><br>[ID: 23525113]"

Fernández-Marín H, Bruner G, Gomez EB, Nash DR, Boomsma JJ, Wcislo WT<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Multipartner mutualisms have potentially complex dynamics, with compensatory responses when one partner is lost or relegated to a minor role. Fungus-growing ants (Attini) are mutualistic associates of basidiomycete fungi and antibiotic-producing actinomycete bacteria; the former are attacked by specialized fungi (Escovopsis) and diverse generalist microbes. Ants deploy biochemical defenses from bacteria and metapleural glands (MGs) and express different behaviors to control contaminants. We studied four Trachymyrmex species that differed in relative abundance of actinomycetes to understand interactions among antimicrobial tactics that are contingent on the nature of infection. MG grooming rate and actinomycete abundance were negatively correlated. The two species with high MG grooming rates or abundant actinomycetes made relatively little use of behavioral defenses. Conversely, the two species with relatively modest biochemical defenses relied heavily on behavior. Trade-offs suggest that related species can evolutionarily diverge to rely on different defense mechanisms against the same threat. Neither bacterial symbionts nor MG secretions thus appear to be essential for mounting defenses against the specialized pathogen Escovopsis, but reduced investment in one of these defense modes tends to increase investment in the other.</em></small><br>[ID: 23535621]"

Maehara T, Ichinose H, Furukawa T, Ogasawara W, Takabatake K, Kaneko S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ethanol production by Flammulina velutipes from high substrate concentrations was evaluated. F. velutipes produces approximately 40-60 g l(-1) ethanol from 15% (w/v) D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, sucrose, maltose, and cellobiose, with the highest conversion rate of 83% observed using cellobiose as a carbon source. We also attempted to assess direct ethanol fermentation from sugarcane bagasse cellulose (SCBC) by F. velutipes. The hydrolysis rate of 15% (w/v) SCBC with commercial cellulase was approximately 20%. In contrast, F. velutipes was able to produce a significant amount of ethanol from 15% SCBC with the production of β-glucosidase, cellobohydrolase, and cellulase, although the addition of a small amount of commercial cellulase to the culture was required for the conversion. When 9 mg g(-1) biomass of commercial cellulase was added to cultures, 0.36 g of ethanol was produced from 1 g of cellulose, corresponding to an ethanol conversion rate of 69.6%. These results indicate that F. velutipes would be useful for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass to bioethanol.</em></small><br>[ID: 23537879]"

Upadhyaya CP, Gururani MA, Prasad R, Verma A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Piriformospora indica is an axenically cultivable phytopromotional endosymbiont that mimics capabilities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. This is a basidiomycete of the Sebacinaceae family, which promotes growth, development, and seed production in a variety of plant species. We report that the cell wall extract (CWE) from P. indica induces tuberization in vitro and promotes tuber growth and yield in potato. The CWE altered the calcium signaling pathway that regulates tuberization process. An increase in tuber number and size was correlated with increased transcript expression of the two Ca(2+)-dependant proteins (CaM1 and St-CDPK1) and the lipoxygenase (LOX) mRNA, which are known to play distinct roles in potato tuberization. External supplementation of Ca(2+) ions induced a similar set of tuberization pathway genes, indicating presence of an active Ca(2+) in the CWE of P. indica. Since potato tuberization is directly influenced by the presence of microflora in nature, the present study provides an insight into the novel mechanism of potato tuberization in relation to plant-microbe association. Ours is the first report on an in vitro tuber-inducing beneficial fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 23609909]"

Nieuwenhuis BP, Nieuwhof S, Aanen DK<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Before a mycelium of a mushroom-forming basidiomycete develops mushrooms, the monokaryotic mycelium needs to become fertilized. Although the mechanistic details of mating in mushrooms have been studied thoroughly in laboratory research, very little is known on mating patterns in nature. In this study, we performed fine-scale analyses of three populations of Schizophyllum commune from their natural substrate (i.e. dead beech branches). From the three branches, 24, 12, and 24 fruiting bodies were isolated and for each mushroom, the origins of its nuclei and cytoplasm were reconstructed using DNA markers. Nuclear genotypes were determined using sequencing data and mating types, and mitochondrial haplotypes using SNP markers. From these combined data we reconstructed colonization and mating patterns of the mycelia. On each branch, we found multiple dikaryons (3, 3, and 8, respectively); in two instances one nuclear haplotype was shared between two dikaryons and in two other cases a nuclear haplotype was shared between three dikaryons. Each dikaryon always had a single mitochondrial haplotype. These findings indicate that mating usually is not symmetrical and that a monokaryon is most likely fertilized by a small monokaryon, a spore or a dikaryon. Sharing of nuclear haplotype between different dikaryons resulted either from multiple fertilizations of a single monokaryon, if the dikaryons had identical mitochondrial haplotypes, or, if the dikaryons had different mitochondrial haplotypes, most likely from secondary matings between a monokaryon and a dikaryon (Buller phenomenon). We conclude that mating in S. commune between same-sized monokaryons with reciprocal migration, as generally described in textbooks, is rare in nature. We discuss the implications of non-symmetric mating for basidiomycete evolution. </em></small><br>[ID: 23644093]"

Raffaello T, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum is the causative agent of butt and root rot disease of conifer trees and it's one of the most destructive conifer pathogen in the northern hemisphere. Because of the intrinsic difficulties in genome manipulation in this fungus, most studies have been focused on gene expression analysis using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR is a powerful technique but its reliability resides in the correct selection of a set of reference genes used in the data normalization. In this study, we determined the expression stability of 11 selected reference genes in H. annosum. Almost nothing has so far been published about validation of a set of reference genes to be used in gene expression experiments in this fungus. Eleven reference genes were validated in H. annosum which was grown on three different substrates: pine bark, pine heartwood, and pine sapwood. Bestkeeper and NormFinder Excel-based software were used to evaluate the reference gene transcripts' stability. The results from these two programs indicated that three reference genes namely Tryp metab, RNA Pol3 TF, and Actin were stable in H. annosum in the conditions studied. Interestingly, the GAPDH transcript which has been extensively used in qPCR data normalization is not the best choice when a wide reference gene selection is available. This work represents the first extensive validation of reference genes in H. annosum providing support for gene expression studies and benefits for the wider forest pathology community.</em></small><br>[ID: 23645035]"

Donaldson ME, Saville BJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ustilago maydis infection of Zea mays leads to the production of thick-walled diploid teliospores that are the dispersal agent for this pathogen. Transcriptome analyses of this model biotrophic basidiomycete fungus identified natural antisense transcripts (NATs) complementary to 247 open reading frames. The U. maydis NAT cDNAs were fully sequenced and annotated. Strand-specific RT-PCR screens confirmed expression and identified NATs preferentially expressed in the teliospore. Targeted screens revealed four U. maydis NATs that are conserved in a related fungus. Expression of NATs in haploid cells, where they are not naturally occurring, resulted in increased steady-state levels of some complementary mRNAs. The expression of one NAT, as-um02151, in haploid cells resulted in a twofold increase in complementary mRNA levels, the formation of sense-antisense double-stranded RNAs, and unchanged Um02151 protein levels. This led to a model for NAT function in the maintenance and expression of stored teliospore mRNAs. In testing this model by deletion of the regulatory region, it was determined that alteration in NAT expression resulted in decreased pathogenesis in both cob and seedling infections. This annotation and functional analysis supports multiple roles for U. maydis NATs in controlling gene expression and influencing pathogenesis. </em></small><br>[ID: 23650872]"

GB 4-2 (GB 4-2) enhances spruce defense against the fungus. To identify whether these bacteria influence the availability of the fungal phytotoxin fomannoxin and hence spruce infection, we analyzed the fomannoxin yield in H. abietinum 331-AcH 505 dual cultures. Further, the fate of fomannoxin was studied by adding the compound to cultures of AcH 505, GB 4-2 and nine other soil streptomycetes. Culture filtrates were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by HPLC. Structures of novel compounds were elucidated by HPLC-HR-ESI-Orbitrap-MS and NMR spectroscopy. Phytotoxicity of the compounds was determined by in vivo measurement of maximum photosystem II efficiency of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. The amount of fomannoxin in H. abietinum 331-AcH 505 dual cultures was reduced compared to axenic fungus cultures and fungus-plant dual cultures. Following addition of fomannoxin to AcH 505 cultures, the compound disappeared and three novel fomannoxin derivatives without phytotoxic activity were detected. Another novel compound, fomannoxin amide, was discovered following fomannoxin addition to GB 4-2 cultures. Nine other streptomycetes converted fomannoxin into fomannoxin acid or fomannoxin amide. Both compounds exhibit the same phytotoxicity as fomannoxin. We, thus, conclude that the streptomycete-mediated modulation of spruce infection with H. abietinum 331 does not depend on the availability of fomannoxin. We further add evidence to the observation that the lipophilic side chain of fomannoxin is an important structural element for its phytotoxicity. </em></small><br>[ID: 23674123]"

We revisited the life cycle of this fungus. Unlike other Ustilaginales, mating of sporidia was never observed and monoclonal cultures of monokaryotic sporidia were infectious in the absence of mating with compatible partner. These data argued for an atypical monokaryotic diploid cell cycle of M. penicillariae, where teliospores only form solopathogenic sporidia. After inoculation of monoclonal solopathogenic strains on spikelets, the fungus infects the ovaries and induces the folding of the micropilar lips, as observed during early pollination steps. The infected embryo then becomes disorganized and the fungus invades peripheral ovary tissues before sporulating. We evaluated the systemic growth abilities of the fungus. After root inoculation, mycelium was observed around and inside the roots. As argued by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection using specific primers for M. penicillariae, the fungus can grow from roots to the caulinar meristems. In spite of this systemic growth, no sori were formed on the varieties of pearl millet tested after root inoculation. All together, these data suggest that the reduced life cycle of M. penicillariae--i.e. dispersal of 'ready to infect' solopathogenic sporidia, floral infection--is an adaptation to the aetiology of this disease to short-cycle pearl millet varieties from the sub-Sahel.</em></small><br>[ID: 23719218]"

Mushroom mating type loci (MAT) encode for dozens or hundreds of incompatibility alleles whose loss from the population is greatly restricted through negative frequency selection, leading to a system of alleles with highly divergent sequences. Here, we use DNA sequences of homeodomain (HD) encoding genes at the MAT locus of five closely related species of the root rot basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato to show that the extended coalescence time of MAT alleles greatly predates speciation in the group, contrasting loci outside of MAT that show allele divergences largely consistent with the species phylogeny with those of MAT, which show rampant trans-species polymorphism. We observe a roughly 6-fold greater genealogical depth and polymorphism of MAT compared with non-MAT that argues for the maintenance of balanced polymorphism for a minimum duration of 24 My based on a molecular-clock calibrated species phylogeny. As with other basidiomycete HD genes, balancing selection appears to be concentrated at the specificity-determining region in the N-terminus of the protein based on identification of codons under selection and the absence of recombination within the region. However, the elevated polymorphism extends into the nonspecificity determining regions as well as a neighboring non-MAT gene, the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP). In doing so, increased divergence should decrease recombination among alleles and as a by-product create incompatibilities in the functional domains not involved in allele recognition but in regulating sexual development. </em></small><br>[ID: 23864721]"

After culturing the fungus and obtaining its various stages of development in triplicate, we carried out total RNA extraction and subsequent complementary DNA synthesis. To analyze DNA and RNA polymerase expression levels, we performed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for various fungal phases of development. Our results showed that DNA and RNA polymerase gene expression in the primordium phase of M. perniciosa is related to a potential defense mechanism against T. cacao oxidative attack.</em></small><br>[ID: 23913377]"

Pedrotti L, Mueller MJ, Waller F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Piriformosporaindica is a basidiomycete fungus colonizing roots of a wide range of higher plants, including crop plants and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies have shown that P. indica improves growth, and enhances systemic pathogen resistance in leaves of host plants. To investigate systemic effects within the root system, we established a hydroponic split-root cultivation system for Arabidopsis. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we show that initial P. indica colonization triggers a local, transient response of several defense-related transcripts, of which some were also induced in shoots and in distal, non-colonized roots of the same plant. Systemic effects on distal roots included the inhibition of secondary P. indica colonization. Faster and stronger induction of defense-related transcripts during secondary inoculation revealed that a P. indica pretreatment triggers root-wide priming of defense responses, which could cause the observed reduction of secondary colonization levels. Secondary P. indica colonization also induced defense responses in distant, already colonized parts of the root. Endophytic fungi therefore trigger a spatially specific response in directly colonized and in systemic root tissues of host plants. </em></small><br>[ID: 23922705]"

Jung WH, Do E<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Iron sequestration by the vertebrate host is considered an efficient defense mechanism against pathogenic microbes. However, this mechanism, so called nutritional immunity, is often overcome by the iron acquisition systems that have evolved in microbial pathogens. Numerous studies have been carried out to identify the key components of these systems and to understand their underlying mechanisms, including recent investigations in the basidiomycete fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Iron acquisition is essential for the survival and pathogenesis of this fungus within vertebrate hosts. Growing evidence suggests that the fungus is able to utilize several different iron sources available in the host, and that the intracellular or extracellular localization of the pathogen influences its iron acquisition strategy.

Juvvadi PR, Gehrke C, Fortwendel JR, Lamoth F, Soderblom EJ, Cook EC, Hast MA, Asfaw YG, Moseley MA, Creamer TP, Steinbach WJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is a leading infectious killer in immunocompromised patients. Calcineurin, a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein phosphatase comprised of calcineurin A (CnaA) and calcineurin B (CnaB) subunits, localizes at the hyphal tips and septa to direct A. fumigatus invasion and virulence. Here we identified a novel serine-proline rich region (SPRR) located between two conserved CnaA domains, the CnaB-binding helix and the CaM-binding domain, that is evolutionarily conserved and unique to filamentous fungi and also completely absent in human calcineurin. Phosphopeptide enrichment and tandem mass spectrometry revealed the phosphorylation of A. fumigatus CnaA in vivo at four clustered serine residues (S406, S408, S410 and S413) in the SPRR. Mutation of the SPRR serine residues to block phosphorylation led to significant hyphal growth and virulence defects, indicating the requirement of calcineurin phosphorylation at the SPRR for its activity and function. Complementation analyses of the A. fumigatus ΔcnaA strain with cnaA homologs from the pathogenic basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, the pathogenic zygomycete Mucor circinelloides, the closely related filamentous fungi Neurospora crassa, and the plant pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, revealed filamentous fungal-specific phosphorylation of CnaA in the SPRR and SPRR homology-dependent restoration of hyphal growth. Surprisingly, circular dichroism studies revealed that, despite proximity to the CaM-binding domain of CnaA, phosphorylation of the SPRR does not alter protein folding following CaM binding. Furthermore, mutational analyses in the catalytic domain, CnaB-binding helix, and the CaM-binding domains revealed that while the conserved PxIxIT substrate binding motif in CnaA is indispensable for septal localization, CaM is required for its function at the hyphal septum but not for septal localization. We defined an evolutionarily conserved novel mode of calcineurin regulation by phosphorylation in filamentous fungi in a region absent in humans. These findings suggest the possibility of harnessing this unique SPRR for innovative antifungal drug design to combat invasive aspergillosis. </em></small><br>[ID: 23990785]"

Garbelotto M, Guglielmo F, Mascheretti S, Croucher PJ, Gonthier P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A population genetics approach is used to identify the most likely introduction site and introduction pathway for the North American forest pathogen Heterobasidion irregulare using 101 isolates from six sites in Italy and 34 isolates from five sites in North America. Diversity indices based on sequences from ten loci indicate the highest diversity in Italy is found in Castelfusano/Castelporziano and that diversity progressively decreases with increasing distance from that site. AMOVA, Bayesian clustering and principal coordinates analyses based on 12 SSR loci indicate high levels of gene flow among sites, high frequency of admixing, and fail to identify groups of genotypes exclusive to single locations. Cumulatively, these analyses suggest the current infestation is the result of multiple genotypes expanding their range from a single site. Based on two sequenced loci, a single source site in North America could provide enough variability to explain the variability observed in Italy. These results support the notion that H. irregulare was introduced originally in Castelporziano: because Castelporziano has been sealed off from the rest of the world for centuries except for a camp set up by the US military in 1944, we conclude the fungus may have been transported in infected wood used by the military. Finally, spatial autocorrelation analyses using SSR data indicate a significant under-dispersion of alleles up to 0.5-10 km, while a significant overdispersion of alleles was detected at distances over 80 km: these ranges can be used to make predictions on the likely dispersal potential of the invasive pathogen.</em></small><br>[ID: 24033583]"

Toju H, Yamamoto S, Sato H, Tanabe AS<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Most terrestrial plants interact with diverse clades of mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi in their roots. Through belowground plant-fungal interactions, dominant plants can benefit by interacting with host-specific mutualistic fungi and proliferate in a community based on positive plant-mutualistic fungal feedback. On the other hand, subordinate plant species may persist in the community by sharing other sets (functional groups) of fungal symbionts with each other. Therefore, revealing how diverse clades of root-associated fungi are differentially hosted by dominant and subordinate plant species is essential for understanding plant community structure and dynamics. Based on 454-pyrosequencing, we determined the community composition of root-associated fungi on 36 co-occurring plant species in an oak-dominated forest in northern Japan and statistically evaluated the host preference phenotypes of diverse mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi. An analysis of 278 fungal taxa indicated that an ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete fungus in the genus Lactarius and a possibly endophytic ascomycete fungus in the order Helotiales significantly favored the dominant oak (Quercus) species. In contrast, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were generally shared among subordinate plant species. Although fungi with host preferences contributed to the compartmentalization of belowground plant-fungal associations, diverse clades of ectomycorrhizal fungi and possible root endophytes were associated not only with the dominant Quercus but also with the remaining plant species. Our findings suggest that dominant-ectomycorrhizal and subordinate plant species can host different subsets of root-associated fungi, and diverse clades of generalist fungi can counterbalance the compartmentalization of plant-fungal associations. Such insights into the overall structure of belowground plant-fungal associations will help us understand the mechanisms that facilitate the coexistence of plant species in natural communities. </em></small><br>[ID: 24250752]"

Ganoderma formosanum is a native Ganoderma species isolated in Taiwan, and we have previously demonstrated that PS-F2, a polysaccharide fraction purified from the submerged culture broth of G. formosanum, exhibits immunostimulatory properties in macrophages. In this study, we further characterized the adjuvant functions of PS-F2. In vitro, PS-F2 stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) to produce proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-12/IL-23 p40. PS-F2 also stimulated DCs to express the maturation markers CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II. In a murine splenocyte culture, PS-F2 treatment resulted in elevated expression of T-bet and interferon (IFN)-γ in T lymphocytes. When used as an adjuvant in vivo with the ovalbumin (OVA) antigen, PS-F2 stimulated OVA-specific antibody production and primed IFN-γ production in OVA-specific T lymphocytes. PS-F2-adjuvated immunization also induced OVA-specific CTLs, which protected mice from a challenge with tumor cells expressing OVA. Collectively, our data show that PS-F2 functions as an adjuvant capable of inducing a Th1-polarized adaptive immune response, which would be useful in vaccines against viruses and tumors.</em></small><br>[ID: 24252697]"

It appears that this fungus, a Basidiomycete, is responsible for the ability of the ants to utilize most of the available woody plant species. Tannins and other phenolics are ubiquitous secondary chemicals in woody plants, and Basidiomycete fungi produce enzymes, such as polyphenol oxidase, that are capable of polymerizing and inactivating the phenolics. This study evaluates the effects of a condensed and a hydrolyzable tannin on the activity of polyphenoi oxidase and the growth of the fungus. I hypothesized that low concentrations of tannin would not inhibit polyphenol oxidase activity but high concentrations would inhibit the enzyme. Consequently, I predicted that only high concentrations of tannin would inhibit fungal growth. Laboratory assays with the fungus indicated that hydrolyzable tannin (tannic acid) and condensed tannin (quebracho tannin) differ in the mechanism of inhibition. Tannic acid does not inhibit polyphenol oxidase activity but does inhibit fungal growth. Quebracho tannin, however, inhibits both polyphenol oxidase activity and fungal growth.

Nichols-Orians C<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Field experiments indicate that the foliar concentration of condensed tannin affects the selection of leaf material ofInga oerstediana Benth., a tropical legume tree, by leaf cutter ants. In one study an increase in tannin concentration was correlated with a decrease in the acceptability of leaves to leaf-cutter ants, except at low tannin concentrations. Protein concentration was not correlated with acceptability nor was the ratio of protein to tannin. Results from a second study suggest that when the concentration of tannin was low the ants appear to select leaves on the basis of nutrient availability. Laboratory assays with the ants indicated that quebracho tannin, a commercially available condensed tannin, inhibits foraging ants. Again, at lower concentrations, quebracho tannin appeared to have little affect on the ants. The fungus the ants cultivate is a wood-rotting Basidiomycete that produces enzymes, such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO), that are capable of inactivating tannins. The activity of these PPOs may explain why leaf-cutter ants are undeterred by low concentrations of condensed tannins. I hypothesized that PPO activity would be absent from fungal cultures without tannin and that only high concentrations of tannin would inhibit the fungus. Cultures with and without tannin showed similar PPO activity. Thus PPO activity is constitutive. In fact, as fungal biomass increased, so did PPO activity. As hypothesized, only high concentrations of quebracho tannin inhibited PPO activity and fungal growth. However, it is not clear whether the ants can discriminate between concentrations that do and do not inhibit the fungus. </em></small><br>[ID: 24259176]"

Kariman K, Barker SJ, Jost R, Finnegan PM, Tibbett M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>• Most terrestrial plants form mutually beneficial symbioses with specific soil-borne fungi known as mycorrhiza. In a typical mycorrhizal association, fungal hyphae colonize plant roots, explore the soil beyond the rhizosphere and provide host plants with nutrients that might be chemically or physically inaccessible to root systems. • Here, we combined nutritional, radioisotopic ((33)P) and genetic approaches to describe a plant growth promoting symbiosis between the basidiomycete fungus Austroboletus occidentalis and jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), which has quite different characteristics. • We show that the fungal partner does not colonize plant roots; hyphae are localized to the rhizosphere soil and vicinity and consequently do not transfer nutrients located beyond the rhizosphere. Transcript profiling of two high-affinity phosphate (Pi) transporter genes (EmPHT1;1 and EmPHT1;2) and hyphal-mediated (33)Pi uptake suggest that the Pi uptake shifts from an epidermal to a hyphal pathway in ectomycorrhizal plants (Scleroderma sp.), similar to arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses, whereas A. occidentalis benefits its host indirectly. The enhanced rhizosphere carboxylates are linked to growth and nutritional benefits in the novel symbiosis. • This work is a starting point for detailed mechanistic studies on other basidiomycete-woody plant relationships, where a continuum between heterotrophic rhizosphere fungi and plant beneficial symbioses is likely to exist.</em></small><br>[ID: 24279681]"

Raffaello T, Chen H, Kohler A, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The success of many wood decaying fungi lies in their ability to overcome unfavourable environmental conditions within and outside of litter and wood debris. Although so much has been learned about the ecology, taxonomy and physiology of several wood decaying basidiomycete fungi, the molecular basis for their survival in a diverse range of substrates and ecological habitats has been very little studied. Using the wood decay fungus (Heterobasidion annosum s.s.) as a model, we investigated its transcriptomic response when exposed to several environmental stressors (high and low temperature, osmotic stress, oxidative stress and nutrient starvation) and during growth on specific pine wood compartments (bark, sapwood and heartwood). Among other genes and pathways, we documented the specific induction of the major facilitator superfamily 1 and cytochrome P450 families at low temperature, and protein kinases together with transcription factors during starvation. On the other hand, during saprotrophic growth, we observed the induction of many glycosyl hydrolases, three multi-copper oxidases (MCO), five manganese peroxidases (MnP) and one oxidoreductase which are specific for wood degradation. This is the first study providing insights on the potential mechanisms for adaptation to abiotic stresses and pine heartwood degradation in H. annosum s.s. </em></small><br>[ID: 24286289]"

Longobardi S, Gravagnuolo AM, Rea I, De Stefano L, Marino G, Giardina P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungal hydrophobins are amphipathic self-assembling proteins. Vmh2 hydrophobin, prepared from mycelial cultures of the basidiomycete fungus Pleurotus ostreatus, spontaneously forms a stable and homogeneous layer on solid surfaces and is able to strongly absorb proteins even in their active forms. In this work, we have exploited the Vmh2 self-assembled layer as a novel coating of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) steel sample-loading plate. Mixtures of standard proteins, as well as tryptic peptides, in the nanomolar-femtomolar range were analyzed in the presence of salts and denaturants. As evidence on a real complex sample, crude human serum was also analyzed and spectra over a wide mass range were acquired. A comparison of this novel coating method with both standard desalting techniques and recently reported on-plate desalting methods was also performed. The results demonstrate that Vmh2 coating of MALDI plates allows for a very simple and effective desalting method suitable for development of lab-on-a-plate platforms focused on proteomic applications. </em></small><br>[ID: 24287080]"

Lücking R, Lawrey JD, Gillevet PM, Sikaroodi M, Dal-Forno M, Berger SA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the nuclear rDNA cistron represents the barcoding locus for Fungi. Intragenomic variation of this multicopy gene can interfere with accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of biological entities. We investigated the amount and nature of this variation for the lichenized fungus Cora inversa in the Hygrophoraceae (Basidiomycota: Agaricales), analyzing base call and length variation in ITS1 454 pyrosequencing data of three samples of the target mycobiont, for a total of 16,665 reads obtained from three separate repeats of the same samples under different conditions. Using multiple fixed alignment methods (PaPaRa) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis (RAxML), we assessed phylogenetic relationships of the obtained reads, together with Sanger ITS sequences from the same samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all ITS1 reads belonged to a single species, C. inversa. Pyrosequencing data showed 266 insertion sites in addition to the 325 sites expected from Sanger sequences, for a total of 15,654 insertions (0.94 insertions per read). An additional 3,279 substitutions relative to the Sanger sequences were detected in the dataset, out of 5,461,125 bases to be called. Up to 99.3% of the observed indels in the dataset could be interpreted as 454 pyrosequencing errors, approximately 65% corresponding to incorrectly recovered homopolymer segments, and 35% to carry-forward-incomplete-extension errors. Comparison of automated clustering and alignment-based phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that clustering of these reads produced a 35-fold overestimation of biological diversity in the dataset at the 95% similarity threshold level, whereas phylogenetic analysis using a maximum likelihood approach accurately recovered a single biological entity. We conclude that variation detected in 454 pyrosequencing data must be interpreted with great care and that a combination of a sufficiently large number of reads per taxon, a set of Sanger references for the same taxon, and at least two runs under different emulsion PCR and sequencing conditions, are necessary to reliably separate biological variation from 454 sequencing errors. Our study shows that clustering methods are highly sensitive to artifactual sequence variation and inadequate to properly recover biological diversity in a dataset, if sequencing errors are substantial and not removed prior to clustering analysis.</em></small><br>[ID: 24343640]"

Mixia osmundae has the smallest plant pathogenic basidiomycete genome sequenced to date, at 13.6 Mb, with very few repeats, high gene density, and relatively few significant gene family gains. The genome shows that the yeast state of M. osmundae is haploid and the lack of segregation of mating genes suggests that the spores produced on Osmunda spp. fronds are probably asexual. However, our finding of a complete complement of mating and meiosis genes suggests the capacity to undergo sexual reproduction.

Chen W, Wellings C, Chen X, Kang Z, Liu T<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a serious disease of wheat occurring in most wheat areas with cool and moist weather conditions during the growing season. The basidiomycete fungus is an obligate biotrophic parasite that is difficult to culture on artificial media. Pst is a macrocyclic, heteroecious fungus that requires both primary (wheat or grasses) and alternate (Berberis or Mahonia spp.) host plants to complete its life cycle. Urediniospores have the capacity for wind dispersal over long distances, which may, under high inoculum pressure, extend to thousands of kilometres from the initial infection sites. Stripe rust, which is considered to be the current major rust disease affecting winter cereal production across the world, has been studied intensively for over a century. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the Pst-wheat pathosystem, with emphasis on the life cycle, uredinial infection process, population biology of the pathogen, genes for stripe rust resistance in wheat and molecular perspectives of wheat-Pst interactions.</em></small><br>[ID: 24373199]"

Bruce M, Neugebauer KA, Joly DL, Migeon P, Cuomo CA, Wang S, Akhunov E, Bakkeren G, Kolmer JA, Fellers JP<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Wheat leaf rust, caused by the basidiomycete Puccinia triticina, can cause yield losses of up to 20% in wheat producing regions. During infection, the fungus forms haustoria that secrete proteins into the plant cell and effect changes in plant transcription, metabolism, and defense. It is hypothesized that new races emerge as a result of overcoming plant resistance via changes in the secreted effector proteins. To understand gene expression during infection and find genetic differences associated with races, RNA from wheat leaves infected with six different rust races, at 6 days post inoculation, was sequenced using Illumina. As P. triticina is an obligate biotroph, RNA from both the host and fungi were present and separated by alignment to the P. triticina genome and a wheat EST reference. A total of 222,571 rust contigs were assembled from 165 million reads. An examination of the resulting contigs revealed 532 predicted secreted proteins among the transcripts. Of these, 456 were found in all races. Fifteen genes were found with amino acid changes, corresponding to putative avirulence effectors potentially recognized by 11 different leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes. Twelve of the potential avirulence effectors have no homology to known genes. One gene had significant similarity to cerato-platanin, a known fungal elicitor, and another showed similarity to fungal tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin synthesis. Temporal expression profiles were developed for these genes by qRT-PCR and show that the genes expression patterns were consistent between races from infection initiation to just prior to spore eruption. </em></small><br>[ID: 24454317]"

Valinluck M, Woraratanadharm T, Lu CY, Quintanilla RH Jr, Banuett F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Positional cues localized to distinct cell domains are critical for the generation of cell polarity and cell morphogenesis. These cues lead to assembly of protein complexes that organize the cytoskeleton resulting in delivery of vesicles to sites of polarized growth. Tea4, an SH3 domain protein, was first identified in fission yeast, and is a critical determinant of the axis of polarized growth, a role conserved among ascomycete fungi. Ustilago maydis is a badiomycete fungus that exhibits a yeast-like form that is nonpathogenic and a filamentous form that is pathogenic on maize and teozintle. We are interested in understanding how positional cues contribute to generation and maintenance of these two forms, and their role in pathogenicity. We identified a homologue of fission yeast tea4 in a genetic screen for mutants with altered colony and cell morphology and present here analysis of Tea4 for the first time in a basidiomycete fungus. We demonstrate that Tea4 is an important positional marker for polarized growth and septum location in both forms. We uncover roles for Tea4 in maintenance of cell and neck width, cell separation, and cell wall deposition in the yeast-like form, and in growth rate, formation of retraction septa, growth reversal, and inhibition of budding in the filamentous form. We show that Tea4::GFP localizes to sites of polarized or potential polarized growth in both forms, as observed in ascomycete fungi. We demonstrate an essential role of Tea4 in pathogencity in the absence of cell fusion. Basidiomycete and ascomycete Tea4 homologues share SH3 and Glc7 domains. Tea4 in basidiomycetes has additional domains, which has led us to hypothesize that Tea4 has novel functions in this group of fungi. </em></small><br>[ID: 24613993]"

Suzuki T, Dohra H, Omae S, Takeshima Y, Choi JH, Hirai H, Kawagishi H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Pleurocybella porrigens is a mushroom-forming fungus, which had been consumed as a traditional food in Japan. However, in 2004, 55 people got poisoned by eating the mushroom and 17 people among them died of acute encephalopathy. We have already reported the purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of a lectin from the mushroom (PPL) which might have caused the poisoning. Here, we report the heterologous expression of recombinant PPL by basidiomycete Phanerochaete sordida YK-624. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter was used to drive the expression of the PPL gene (ppl) in P. sordida YK-624. Furthermore, the signal peptide of lignin peroxidase which is an extracellular protein was used to secrete rPPL into extracellular region. Fifteen regenerated clones were cultured on Kirk HNHC broth, and the presence of lectin activity in the culture broth was checked by agglutination assays. The results indicated that the culture broth of rPPL-6 clone showed the strongest hemagglutination activity, and it was therefore used for subsequent analysis. The heterologous expression of rPPL by P. sordida YK-624 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, lectin activity by the hemagglutination assay, and mass of rPPL by MALDI-TOF respectively, indicating that the extracellular secretion of rPPL as active form was successful. </em></small><br>[ID: 24631556]"

Low coverage, high throughput 454 transcriptome sequencing in combination with inverse-PCR was used to identify cDNA sequences. One of the cDNA sequences has been assigned to the Yel1p protein on the basis of identity between the translated protein sequence and the peptide data from the purified protein, and the full length gene sequence has been obtained.

Hane JK, Anderson JP, Williams AH, Sperschneider J, Singh KB<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Rhizoctonia solani is a soil-borne basidiomycete fungus with a necrotrophic lifestyle which is classified into fourteen reproductively incompatible anastomosis groups (AGs). One of these, AG8, is a devastating pathogen causing bare patch of cereals, brassicas and legumes. R. solani is a multinucleate heterokaryon containing significant heterozygosity within a single cell. This complexity posed significant challenges for the assembly of its genome. We present a high quality genome assembly of R. solani AG8 and a manually curated set of 13,964 genes supported by RNA-seq. The AG8 genome assembly used novel methods to produce a haploid representation of its heterokaryotic state. The whole-genomes of AG8, the rice pathogen AG1-IA and the potato pathogen AG3 were observed to be syntenic and co-linear. Genes and functions putatively relevant to pathogenicity were highlighted by comparing AG8 to known pathogenicity genes, orthology databases spanning 197 phytopathogenic taxa and AG1-IA. We also observed SNP-level \"hypermutation\" of CpG dinucleotides to TpG between AG8 nuclei, with similarities to repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Interestingly, gene-coding regions were widely affected along with repetitive DNA, which has not been previously observed for RIP in mononuclear fungi of the Pezizomycotina. The rate of heterozygous SNP mutations within this single isolate of AG8 was observed to be higher than SNP mutation rates observed across populations of most fungal species compared. Comparative analyses were combined to predict biological processes relevant to AG8 and 308 proteins with effector-like characteristics, forming a valuable resource for further study of this pathosystem. Predicted effector-like proteins had elevated levels of non-synonymous point mutations relative to synonymous mutations (dN/dS), suggesting that they may be under diversifying selection pressures. In addition, the distant relationship to sequenced necrotrophs of the Ascomycota suggests the R. solani genome sequence may prove to be a useful resource in future comparative analysis of plant pathogens. </em></small><br>[ID: 24810276]"

Doré J, Marmeisse R, Combier JP, Gay G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We used Agrobacterium-mediated insertional mutagenesis to identify genes in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum that are essential for efficient mycorrhiza formation. One of the mutants presented a dramatically reduced ability to form ectomycorrhizas when grown in the presence of Pinus pinaster. It failed to form mycorrhizas in the presence of glucose at 0.5 g liter(-1), a condition favorable for mycorrhiza formation by the wild-type strain. However, it formed few mycorrhizas when glucose was replaced by fructose or when glucose concentration was increased to 1 g liter(-1). Scanning electron microscopy examination of these mycorrhizas revealed that this mutant was unable to differentiate true fungal sheath and Hartig net. Molecular analyses showed that the single-copy disrupting T-DNA was integrated 6,884 bp downstream from the start codon, of an open reading frame potentially encoding a 3,096-amino-acid-long protein. This gene, which we named HcMycE1, has orthologs in numerous fungi as well as different other eukaryotic microorganisms. RNAi inactivation of HcMycE1 in the wild-type strain also led to a mycorrhizal defect, demonstrating that the nonmycorrhizal phenotype of the mutant was due to mutagenic T-DNA integration in HcMycE1. In the wild-type strain colonizing P. pinaster roots, HcMycE1 was transiently upregulated before symbiotic structure differentiation. Together with the inability of the mutant to differentiate these structures, this suggests that HcMycE1 plays a crucial role upstream of the fungal sheath and Hartig net differentiation. This study provides the first characterization of a fungal mutant altered in mycorrhizal ability. </em></small><br>[ID: 24918768]"

Ali S, Laurie JD, Linning R, Cervantes-Chávez JA, Gaudet D, Bakkeren G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete smut fungus Ustilago hordei was previously shown to comprise isolates that are avirulent on various barley host cultivars. Through genetic crosses we had revealed that a dominant avirulence locus UhAvr1 which triggers immunity in barley cultivar Hannchen harboring resistance gene Ruh1, resided within an 80-kb region. DNA sequence analysis of this genetically delimited region uncovered the presence of 7 candidate secreted effector proteins. Sequence comparison of their coding sequences among virulent and avirulent parental and field isolates could not distinguish UhAvr1 candidates. Systematic deletion and complementation analyses revealed that UhAvr1 is UHOR_10022 which codes for a small effector protein of 171 amino acids with a predicted 19 amino acid signal peptide. Virulence in the parental isolate is caused by the insertion of a fragment of 5.5 kb with similarity to a common U. hordei transposable element (TE), interrupting the promoter of UhAvr1 and thereby changing expression and hence recognition of UhAVR1p. This rearrangement is likely caused by activities of TEs and variation is seen among isolates. Using GFP-chimeric constructs we show that UhAvr1 is induced only in mated dikaryotic hyphae upon sensing and infecting barley coleoptile cells. When infecting Hannchen, UhAVR1p causes local callose deposition and the production of reactive oxygen species and necrosis indicative of the immune response. UhAvr1 does not contribute significantly to overall virulence. UhAvr1 is located in a cluster of ten effectors with several paralogs and over 50% of TEs. This cluster is syntenous with clusters in closely-related U. maydis and Sporisorium reilianum. In these corn-infecting species, these clusters harbor however more and further diversified homologous effector families but very few TEs. This increased variability may have resulted from past selection pressure by resistance genes since U. maydis is not known to trigger immunity in its corn host. </em></small><br>[ID: 24992661]"

This allowed a study of the segregation of molecular markers and virulence in the progeny isolates, and of the development of fungal sexual structures and spore forms. Pycnia and aecia were obtained after inoculation of B. vulgaris with basidiospores resulting from germinating teliospores from infected wheat leaves. Subsequent inoculation of wheat with aeciospores from bulked aecia resulted in 16 progeny isolates of the S1 generation. Genotyping with 42 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers confirmed a parental origin of progeny isolates. Of the 42 analyzed loci, 15 were heterozygous in the parental isolate and 14 revealed segregation in the progenies. This resulted in 11 new multilocus genotypes (MLGs), which confirmed segregation following sexual reproduction. Additionally, parental and progeny isolates were phenotyped using a genetic stock of wheat genotypes representing 21 resistance genes. All S1 progeny isolates had virulence for 14 out of 15 loci where the parental isolate was virulent. This was consistent with the hypothesis that virulence in plant pathogens is often recessive to avirulence, i.e., only expressed in a homozygous state. Furthermore, no segregation was observed for five out of six loci, for which the parental isolate had an avirulent phenotype. The results for one of the two segregating virulence/avirulence loci suggested that the parental isolate was heterozygous with Avr alleles resulting in different but clearly avirulent phenotypes.

Alias N, Ahmad Mazian M, Salleh AB, Basri M, Rahman RN<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Psychrophilic basidiomycete yeast, Glaciozyma antarctica strain PI12, was shown to be a protease-producer. Isolation of the PI12 protease gene from genomic and mRNA sequences allowed determination of 19 exons and 18 introns. Full-length cDNA of PI12 protease gene was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) strategy with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2892 bp, coded for 963 amino acids. PI12 protease showed low homology with the subtilisin-like protease from fungus Rhodosporidium toruloides (42% identity) and no homology to other psychrophilic proteases. The gene encoding mature PI12 protease was cloned into Pichia pastoris expression vector, pPIC9, and positioned under the induction of methanol-alcohol oxidase (AOX) promoter. The recombinant PI12 protease was efficiently secreted into the culture medium driven by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor signal sequence. The highest protease production (28.3 U/ml) was obtained from P. pastoris GS115 host (GpPro2) at 20°C after 72 hours of postinduction time with 0.5% (v/v) of methanol inducer. The expressed protein was detected by SDS-PAGE and activity staining with a molecular weight of 99 kDa. </em></small><br>[ID: 25093119]"

Vainio EJ, Müller MM, Korhonen K, Piri T, Hantula J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungal viruses (mycoviruses) with RNA genomes are believed to lack extracellular infective particles. These viruses are transmitted laterally among fungal strains through mycelial anastomoses or vertically via their infected spores, but little is known regarding their prevalence and patterns of dispersal under natural conditions. Here, we examined, in detail, the spatial and temporal changes in a mycovirus community and its host fungus Heterobasidion parviporum, the most devastating fungal pathogen of conifers in the Boreal forest region. During the 7-year sampling period, viruses accumulated in clonal host individuals as a result of indigenous viruses spreading within and between clones as well as novel strains arriving via airborne spores. Viral community changes produced pockets of heterogeneity within large H. parviporum clones. The appearance of novel viral infections in aging clones indicated that transient cell-to-cell contacts between Heterobasidion strains are likely to occur more frequently than what was inferred from genotypic analyses. Intraspecific variation was low among the three partitivirus species at the study site, whereas the unassigned viral species HetRV6 was highly polymorphic. The accumulation of point mutations during persistent infections resulted in viral diversification, that is, the presence of nearly identical viral sequence variants within single clones. Our results also suggest that co-infections by distantly related viral species are more stable than those between conspecific strains, and mutual exclusion may play a role in determining mycoviral communities. </em></small><br>[ID: 25126757]"

Nehls U, Dietz S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Three aspects have to be taken into consideration when discussing cellular water and solute permeability of fungal cells: cell wall properties, membrane permeability, and transport through proteinaceous pores (the main focus of this review). Yet, characterized major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) can be grouped into three functional categories: (mainly) water transporting aquaporins, aquaglyceroporins that confer preferentially solute permeability (e.g., glycerol and ammonia), and bifunctional aquaglyceroporins that can facilitate efficient water and solute transfer. Two ancestor proteins, a water (orthodox aquaporin) and a solute facilitator (aquaglyceroporin), are supposed to give rise to today's MIPs. Based on primary sequences of fungal MIPs, orthodox aquaporins/X-intrinsic proteins (XIPs) and FPS1-like/Yfl054-like/other aquaglyceroporins are supposed to be respective sister groups. However, at least within the fungal kingdom, no easy functional conclusion can be drawn from the phylogenetic position of a given protein within the MIP pedigree. In consequence, ecophysiological prediction of MIP relevance is not feasible without detailed functional analysis of the respective protein and expression studies. To illuminate the diverse MIP implications in fungal lifestyle, our current knowledge about protein function in two organisms, baker's yeast and the Basidiomycotic Laccaria bicolor, an ectomycorrhizal model fungus, was exemplarily summarized in this review. MIP function has been investigated in such a depth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that a system-wide view is possible. Yeast lifestyle, however, is special in many circumstances. Therefore, L. bicolor as filamentous Basidiomycete was added and allows insight into a very different way of life. Special emphasis was laid in this review onto ecophysiological interpretation of MIP function. </em></small><br>[ID: 25213914]"

The extracellular Cel12A is one of the few endo-1,4-β-glucanase produced by G. trabeum. Here we cloned cel12A and heterologously expressed it in Aspergillus niger. The identity of the resulting recombinant protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry. We used the purified GtCel12A to determine its substrate specificity and basic biochemical properties. The G. trabeum Cel12A showed highest activity on β-glucan, followed by lichenan, carboxymethylcellulose, phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and filter paper. The optimal pH and temperature for enzymatic activity were, respectively, 4.5 and 50 °C on β-glucan. Under these conditions specific activity was 239.2 ± 9.1 U mg(-1) and the half-life of the enzyme was 84.6 ± 3.5 hours. Thermofluor studies revealed that the enzyme was most thermal stable at pH 3. Using β-glucan as a substrate, the Km was 3.2 ± 0.5 mg mL(-1) and the Vmax was 0.41 ± 0.02 µmol min(-1). Analysis of the effects of GtCel12A on oat spelt and filter paper by scanning electron microscopy revealed the morphological changes taking place during the process.</em></small><br>[ID: 25251390]"

It was shown that xylanase catalyzed the hydrolysis of xylan with the production of xylose, xylobiose, and xylotetrose and it exhibited properties of endoxylanases. Cellulase hydrolyzed carboxymethylcellulose, xylan, and microcrystalline cellulose with the formation of cellotriose and cellotetraose. For both enzymes, the pH optimum was -4.0. The enzymes exhibited moderate thermostability: xylanase retained 35% of the initial activity for an hour at 60 degrees C; cellulase, 10% under the same conditions.

Santana LS, Costa MG, Pirovani NM, Almeida AF, Alvim FC, Pirovani CP<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In Brazil, most cocoa bean production occurs in Southern Bahia. Witches' broom disease arrived in this area in 1989 and has since caused heavy losses in production. The disease is caused by the basidiomycete fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, a hemibiotrophic fungus that produces the necrosis and ethylene-inducting protein (MpNEP2) during infection; this protein can activate cysteine proteases and induce programmed cell death. Cysteine proteases can be modulated by cystatin. In this study, we overexpressed TcCYS4, a cocoa cystatin, in tobacco plants and evaluated the effect on MpNEP2 in model plants. Tccys4 cDNA was cloned into the pCAMBIA 1390 vector and inserted into the tobacco plants via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Transgene expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. Transcript and protein levels in Tcccys4:tobacco lines were 8.9- and 1.5-fold higher than in wild-type plants (wt). Tcccys4:tobacco lines showed no change in growth compared to wt plants. CO2 net assimilation (A) increased in Tcccys4:tobacco lines compared to wt plants. Only one line showed statistically significant stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) changes. MpNEP2 was infiltered into the foliar mesophyll of Tcccys4:tobacco lines and wt plants, and necrotic lesions were attenuated in lines highly expressing Tccys4. Our results suggest that cocoa cystatin TcCYS4 affects MpNEP2 activity related to the progression of programmed cell death in tobacco plants. This may occur through the action of cystatin to inhibit cysteine proteases activated by MpNEP2 in plant tissues. Further studies are necessary to examine cystatin in the Theobroma cacao-M. perniciosa pathosystem.</em></small><br>[ID: 25299077]"

Fungus-growing attine ants cultivate basidiomycete fungi for food. One cultivar lineage has evolved inflated hyphal tips (gongylidia) that grow in bundles called staphylae, to specifically feed the ants. Here we show extensive regulation and molecular signals of adaptive evolution in gene trancripts associated with gongylidia biosynthesis, morphogenesis and enzymatic plant cell wall degradation in the leaf-cutting ant cultivar Leucoagaricus gongylophorus. Comparative analysis of staphylae growth morphology and transcriptome-wide expressional and nucleotide divergence indicate that gongylidia provide leaf-cutting ants with essential amino acids and plant-degrading enzymes, and that they may have done so for 20-25 million years without much evolutionary change. These molecular traits and signatures of selection imply that staphylae are highly advanced coevolutionary organs that play pivotal roles in the mutualism between leaf-cutting ants and their fungal cultivars. </em></small><br>[ID: 25435021]"

Results from protein identification of tryptic peptides via liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI-MS/MS) analyses revealed 17 protein assignments with differential expression. Downregulation of cytoskeleton β-tubulin 3 indicates that ferruginol has potential to be used as a microtubule-disrupting agent. Downregulation of major facilitator superfamily (MFS)–multiple drug resistance (MDR) transporter and peroxiredoxin TSA1 were observed, suggesting reduction in self-defensive capabilities of T. versicolor. In addition, the proteins involved in polypeptide sorting and DNA repair were also downregulated, while heat shock proteins and autophagy-related protein 7 were upregulated.

To identify the SR region in M. lychnis-dioicae and to study its evolution, we sequenced 12 genomes (6 per mating type) of this species and identified the genomic contigs that show fixed sequence differences between the mating types. We report that the SR region spans more than half of the mat chromosome (>2.3 Mbp) and that it is of very recent origin (∼2 × 10(6) years) as the average sequence divergence between mating types was only 2% in the SR region. This contrasts with a much higher divergence in and around the mating-type determining pheromone receptor locus in the SR, suggesting a recent and massive expansion of the SR region.

Since the first description, fewer than ten basidiomycete DyPs have been purified and characterized, but a large number of sequences are available from genomes. DyPs share a general fold and heme location with chlorite dismutases and other DyP-type related proteins (such as Escherichia coli EfeB), forming the CDE superfamily. Taking into account the lack of an evolutionary relationship with the catalase-peroxidase superfamily, the observed heme pocket similarities must be considered as a convergent type of evolution to provide similar reactivity to the enzyme cofactor. Studies on the Auricularia auricula-judae DyP showed that high-turnover oxidation of anthraquinone type and other DyP substrates occurs via long-range electron transfer from an exposed tryptophan (Trp377, conserved in most basidiomycete DyPs), whose catalytic radical was identified in the H2O2-activated enzyme. The existence of accessory oxidation sites in DyP is suggested by the residual activity observed after site-directed mutagenesis of the above tryptophan. DyP degradation of substituted anthraquinone dyes (such as Reactive Blue 5) most probably proceeds via typical one-electron peroxidase oxidations and product breakdown without a DyP-catalyzed hydrolase reaction. Although various DyPs are able to break down phenolic lignin model dimers, and basidiomycete DyPs also present marginal activity on nonphenolic dimers, a significant contribution to lignin degradation is unlikely because of the low activity on high redox-potential substrates. </em></small><br>[ID: 25637654]"

Li SY, Shi LJ, Ding Y, Nie Y, Tang XM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In this study, a previously unknown fungal immunomodulatory protein (FIP), here called FIP-ppl, was identified from the basidiomycete fungus Postia placenta by searching its genome sequence database using known FIPs as baits, which was the first basidiomycete FIP to be identified outside the order of edible macro fungi. The gene FIP-ppl was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli to produce a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified on a GST affinity column and the protein tag was removed using in situ thrombin cleavage. The purified recombinant protein (rFIP-ppl) displayed hemagglutination activity toward rabbit red blood cells but not against human red blood cells. RFIP-ppl stimulated mouse splenocyte cell proliferation and enhanced interleukin-2 (IL-2) release. Antitumor assays indicated that rFIP-ppl had significant cell proliferation inhibitory activity and apoptotic effects in human tumor cells with more pronounced inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptotic effects on gastric tumor cells (MGC823) than against hepatoma (HepG2) cells. This study confirms an alternative means of identifying, producing, and isolating new FIPs. It may provide convenient access to FIP-ppl with potential human therapeutic applications. </em></small><br>[ID: 25662032]"

Mondal S, Badigannavar AM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The peanut rust disease is an economically important biotic stress that significantly reduces the pod and fodder yield and oil quality. It is caused by the basidiomycete fungus Puccinia arachidis Speg. which belongs to class Pucciniomycetes like other rust fungus but has fewer occurrences in teliospore form. The P. arachidis predominantly spreads by the repeated cycle of uredospores in the field. The disease is prevalent in most of the countries where peanut is cultivated and favored by warm and humid climatic conditions. Despite its economic importance, very limited work has been carried out on host-fungus interaction, fungal genetic diversity, and physiological specialization. The present review describes different aspects of P. arachidis especially its symptomatology, cell biological aspects of pathogenesis, epidemiology, and physiology of resistance as well as developments on genetics and genomics of host resistance, and resistance breeding. The review will help to understand the behavior of this causal organism and the host resistance and subsequently design the breeding approaches to check the spread of the disease. </em></small><br>[ID: 25715683]"

High levels of tropospheric ozone (O3) as an atmospheric pollutant are usually experienced in Mediterranean pine forests. To explore the effect of interaction between the two Heterobasidion species and ozone pollution on P. pinea, an open-top chamber (OTC) experiment was carried out. Five-year-old P. pinea seedlings were inoculated with the fungal species considered (H. irregulare, H. annosum and mock-inoculation as control), and then exposed in charcoal-filtered open-top chambers (CF-OTC) and non-filtered ozone-enriched chambers (NF+) from July to the first week of August 2010 at the experimental facilities of Curno (North Italy). Fungal inoculation effects in an ozone-enriched environment were assessed as: (i) the length of the inoculation lesion; (ii) chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) responses; and (iii) analysis of resin terpenes. Results showed no differences on lesion length between fungal and ozone treatments, whereas the short-term effects of the two stress factors on ChlF indicate an increased photosynthetic efficiency, thus suggesting the triggering of compensation/repair processes. The total amount of resin terpenes is enhanced by fungal infection of both species, but depressed by ozone to the levels observed in mock-inoculated plants. Variations in terpene profiles were also induced by stem base inoculations and ozone treatment. Ozone might negatively affect terpene defences making plants more susceptible to pathogens and insects. </em></small><br>[ID: 25725363]"

(2009) Crystal structure of glycoside hydrolase family 55 β-1,3-glucanase from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium. J. Biol. Chem. 284, 10100-10109). Here, we present high resolution crystal structures of bacterial SacteLam55A from the highly cellulolytic Streptomyces sp. SirexAA-E with bound substrates and product. These structures, along with mutagenesis and kinetic studies, implicate Glu-502 as the catalytic acid (as proposed earlier for Glu-663 in PcLam55A) and a proton relay network of four residues in activating water as the nucleophile. Further, a set of conserved aromatic residues that define the active site apparently enforce an exo-glucanase reactivity as demonstrated by exhaustive hydrolysis reactions with purified laminarioligosaccharides. Two additional aromatic residues that line the substrate-binding channel show substrate-dependent conformational flexibility that may promote processive reactivity of the bound oligosaccharide in the bacterial enzymes. Gene synthesis carried out on ∼30% of the GH55 family gave 34 active enzymes (19% functional coverage of the nonredundant members of GH55). These active enzymes reacted with only laminarin from a panel of 10 different soluble and insoluble polysaccharides and displayed a broad range of specific activities and optima for pH and temperature. Application of this experimental method provides a new, systematic way to annotate glycoside hydrolase phylogenetic space for functional properties. </em></small><br>[ID: 25752603]"

Although information concerning its genome and transcriptome has recently been reported, relatively little information is available for G. lucidum at the proteomic level. In this study, protein fractions from G. lucidum at three developmental stages (16-day mycelia, and fruiting bodies at 60 and 90 days) were prepared and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. A search against the G. lucidum genome database identified 803 proteins. Among these proteins, 61 lignocellulose degrading proteins were detected, most of which (49 proteins) were found in the 90-day fruiting bodies. Fourteen TCA-cycle related proteins, 17 peptidases, two argonaute-like proteins, and two immunomodulatory proteins were also detected. A majority (470) of the 803 proteins had GO annotations and were classified into 36 GO terms, with \"binding\", \"catalytic activity\", and \"hydrolase activity\" having high percentages. Additionally, 357 out of the 803 proteins were assigned to at least one COG functional category and grouped into 22 COG classifications. Based on the results from the proteomic and sequence alignment analyses, a potentially new immunomodulatory protein (GL18769) was expressed and shown to have high immunomodulatory activity. In this study, proteomic and biochemical analyses of G. lucidum were performed for the first time, revealing that proteins from this fungus can play significant bioactive roles and providing a new foundation for the further functional investigations that this fungus merits. </em></small><br>[ID: 25756518]"

Eleven laccase genes, including three novel ones (designated lac1, lac2 and lac4) were identified after sequencing the entire genome of the edible, white-rot fungus Flammulina velutipes. Analysis using bioinformatics revealed that all of the laccases, except lac3, possess a signal peptide. These laccase proteins consist of 502-670 amino acids and have predicted molecular weights ranging from 55kDa to 74kDa. These proteins each contain four copper-binding sites, except for Lac10. Transcriptomes were sequenced at different developmental stages and in different fruiting body tissues to analyze if there was differential expression of laccase genes. The novel laccase gene lac4 exhibited the highest expression levels among all of the observed laccases at every developmental stage and in all fruiting body tissues examined. We conclude that laccases in F. velutipes play a role not only in lignin degradation, but also in fruiting body formation and development.</em></small><br>[ID: 25776201]"

Ianiri G, Idnurm A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungal diseases represent a major burden to health care globally. As with other pathogenic microbes, there is a limited number of agents suitable for use in treating fungal diseases, and resistance to these agents can develop rapidly. Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycete fungus that causes cryptococcosis worldwide in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals. As a basidiomycete, it diverged from other common pathogenic or model ascomycete fungi more than 500 million years ago. Here, we report C. neoformans genes that are essential for viability as identified through forward and reverse genetic approaches, using an engineered diploid strain and genetic segregation after meiosis. The forward genetic approach generated random insertional mutants in the diploid strain, the induction of meiosis and sporulation, and selection for haploid cells with counterselection of the insertion event. More than 2,500 mutants were analyzed, and transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertions in several genes required for viability were identified. The genes include those encoding the thioredoxin reductase (Trr1), a ribosome assembly factor (Rsa4), an mRNA-capping component (Cet1), and others. For targeted gene replacement, the C. neoformans homologs of 35 genes required for viability in ascomycete fungi were disrupted, meiosis and sporulation were induced, and haploid progeny were evaluated for their ability to grow on selective media. Twenty-one (60%) were found to be required for viability in C. neoformans. These genes are involved in mitochondrial translation, ergosterol biosynthesis, and RNA-related functions. The heterozygous diploid mutants were evaluated for haploinsufficiency on a number of perturbing agents and drugs, revealing phenotypes due to the loss of one copy of an essential gene in C. neoformans. This study expands the knowledge of the essential genes in fungi using a basidiomycete as a model organism. Genes that have no mammalian homologs and are essential in both Cryptococcus and ascomycete human pathogens would be ideal for the development of antifungal drugs with broad-spectrum activity.</em></small><br>[ID: 25827419]"

Maestre-Reyna M, Liu WC, Jeng WY, Lee CC, Hsu CA, Wen TN, Wang AH, Shyur LF<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Laccases are multi-copper oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of various organic and inorganic compounds by reducing O2 to water. Here we report the crystal structure at 1.8 Å resolution of a native laccase (designated nLcc4) isolated from a white-rot fungus Lentinus sp. nLcc4 is composed of three cupredoxin-like domains D1-D3 each folded into a Greek key β-barrel topology. T1 and T2/T3 copper binding sites and three N-glycosylated sites at Asn75, Asn238, and Asn458 were elucidated. Initial rate kinetic analysis revealed that the kcat, Km, and kcat/Km of nLcc4 with substrate ABTS were 3,382 s-1, 65.0 ± 6.5 μM, and 52 s-1μM-1, respectively; and the values with lignosulfonic acid determined using isothermal titration calorimetry were 0.234 s-1, 56.7 ± 3.2 μM, and 0.004 s-1μM-1, respectively. Endo H-deglycosylated nLcc4 (dLcc4), with only one GlcNAc residue remaining at each of the three N-glycosylation sites in the enzyme, exhibited similar kinetic efficiency and thermal stability to that of nLcc4. The isolated Lcc4 gene contains an open reading frame of 1563 bp with a deduced polypeptide of 521 amino acid residues including a predicted signaling peptide of 21 residues at the N-terminus. Recombinant wild-type Lcc4 and mutant enzymes N75D, N238D and N458D were expressed in Pichia pastoris cells to evaluate the effect on enzyme activity by single glycosylation site deficiency. The mutant enzymes secreted in the cultural media of P. pastoris cells were observed to maintain only 4-50% of the activity of the wild-type laccase. Molecular dynamics simulations analyses of various states of (de-)glycosylation in nLcc support the kinetic results and suggest that the local H-bond networks between the domain connecting loop D2-D3 and the glycan moieties play a crucial role in the laccase activity. This study provides new insights into the role of glycosylation in the structure and function of a Basidiomycete fungal laccase. </em></small><br>[ID: 25849464]"

Somera AF, Lima AM, Dos Santos-Neto ÁJ, Lanças FM, Bacci M Jr<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Leaf-cutter ants use plant matter to culture the obligate mutualistic basidiomycete Leucoagaricus gongylophorus. This fungus mediates ant nutrition on plant resources. Furthermore, other microbes living in the fungus garden might also contribute to plant digestion. The fungus garden comprises a young sector with recently incorporated leaf fragments and an old sector with partially digested plant matter. Here, we show that the young and old sectors of the grass-cutter Atta bisphaerica fungus garden operate as a biphasic solid-state mixed fermenting system. An initial plant digestion phase occurred in the young sector in the fungus garden periphery, with prevailing hemicellulose and starch degradation into arabinose, mannose, xylose, and glucose. These products support fast microbial growth but were mostly converted into four polyols. Three polyols, mannitol, arabitol, and inositol, were secreted by L. gongylophorus, and a fourth polyol, sorbitol, was likely secreted by another, unidentified, microbe. A second plant digestion phase occurred in the old sector, located in the fungus garden core, comprising stocks of microbial biomass growing slowly on monosaccharides and polyols. This biphasic operation was efficient in mediating symbiotic nutrition on plant matter: the microbes, accounting for 4% of the fungus garden biomass, converted plant matter biomass into monosaccharides and polyols, which were completely consumed by the resident ants and microbes. However, when consumption was inhibited through laboratory manipulation, most of the plant polysaccharides were degraded, products rapidly accumulated, and yields could be preferentially switched between polyols and monosaccharides. This feature might be useful in biotechnology. </em></small><br>[ID: 25911490]"

Jeffery Daim LD, Ooi TE, Ithnin N, Mohd Yusof H, Kulaveerasingam H, Abdul Majid N, Karsani SA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete fungal pathogen Ganoderma boninense is the causative agent for the incurable basal stem rot (BSR) disease in oil palm. This disease causes significant annual crop losses in the oil palm industry. Currently, there is no effective method for disease control and elimination, nor is any molecular marker for early detection of the disease available. An understanding of how BSR affects protein expression in plants may help identify and/or assist in the development of an early detection protocol. Although the mode of infection of BSR disease is primarily via the root system, defense-related genes have been shown to be expressed in both the root and leafs. Thus, to provide an insight into the changes in the global protein expression profile in infected plants, comparative 2DE was performed on leaf tissues sampled from palms with and without artificial inoculation of the Ganoderma fungus. Comparative 2DE revealed that 54 protein spots changed in abundance. A total of 51 protein spots were successfully identified by LC-QTOF MS/MS.

Coconi-Linares N, Ortiz-Vázquez E, Fernández F, Loske AM, Gómez-Lim MA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Phanerochaete chrysosporium belongs to a group of lignin-degrading fungi that secretes various oxidoreductive enzymes, including lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP). Previously, we demonstrated that the heterologous expression of a versatile peroxidase (VP) in P. chrysosporium recombinant strains is possible. However, the production of laccases (Lac) in this fungus has not been completely demonstrated and remains controversial. In order to investigate if the co-expression of Lac and VP in P. chrysosporium would improve the degradation of phenolic and non-phenolic substrates, we tested the constitutive co-expression of the lacIIIb gene from Trametes versicolor and the vpl2 gene from Pleurotus eryngii, and also the endogenous genes mnp1 and lipH8 by shock wave mediated transformation. The co-overexpression of peroxidases and laccases was improved up to five-fold as compared with wild type species. Transformant strains showed a broad spectrum in phenolic/non-phenolic biotransformation and a high percentage in synthetic dye decolorization in comparison with the parental strain. Our results show that the four enzymes can be constitutively expressed in a single transformant of P. chrysosporium in minimal medium.

Eshima Y, Higuchi Y, Kinoshita T, Nakakita S, Takegawa K<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase), which catalyzes hydrolysis of N-linked oligosaccharides, is a useful tool for analyzing oligosaccharide contents of glycoproteins. However, there are only a few known ENGases that can catalyze the hydrolysis of human complex type oligosaccharides, and although commercially available, they are expensive. Here, we report the cloning of two ENGase encoding cDNAs from the basidiomycete fungus Coprinopsis cinerea, Endo-CC1 and Endo-CC2. We successfully expressed recombinant His6-tagged Endo-CC1 and Endo-CC2 in Escherichia coli and purified them for enzymatic characterization. Both Endo-CC1 and Endo-CC2 showed hydrolytic activity on high-mannose and complex type oligosaccharides. Since Endo-CC1 could be prepared more easily than Endo-CC2 from E. coli cultures, we examined the enzymatic properties of Endo-CC1 in detail. Our results showed that Endo-CC1 acted on both N-linked high-mannose type and sialobiantennary type complex oligosaccharides of glycoproteins RNase B and human transferrin, respectively, but not on the sialotriantennary type complex oligosaccharide of glycoprotein fetuin. Examination of the transglycosylation activity of Endo-CC1 revealed that the wild-type Endo-CC1 could not transfer the sialobiantennary type complex oligosaccharide onto the deglycosylated RNase B. To obtain an Endo-CC1 mutant with desired transglycosylation activity, we performed mutation analysis of the active site residue Asn 180 (N180), known to be important for catalysis, by individually replacing it with the remaining 19 amino acid residues. Transglycosylation analyses of these mutants led us to identify one mutant, namely Endo-CC1N180H, which exhibited the desired transglycosylation activity. Taken together, we suggest that Endo-CC1 would potentially be a valuable tool for analyzing oligosaccharides on glycoproteins, as large quantities of it could be made available more easily and less expensively than the currently used enzyme, Endo-M.</em></small><br>[ID: 26197478]"

Oliva J, Rommel S, Fossdal CG, Hietala AM, Nemesio-Gorriz M, Solheim H, Elfstrand M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The white-rot fungus Heterobasidion parviporum Niemelä & Korhonen establishes a necrotrophic interaction with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) causing root and butt rot and growth losses in living trees. The interaction occurs first with the bark and the outer sapwood, as the pathogen enters the tree via wounds or root-to-root contacts. Later, when the fungus reaches the heartwood, it spreads therein creating a decay column, and the interaction mainly occurs in the inner sapwood where the tree creates a reaction zone. While bark and outer sapwood interactions are well studied, little is known about the nature of the transcriptional responses leading to the creation of a reaction zone. In this study, we sampled bark and sapwood both proximal and distal to the reaction zone in artificially inoculated and naturally infected trees. We quantified gene expression levels of candidate genes in secondary metabolite, hormone biosynthesis and signalling pathways using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. An up-regulation of mainly the phenylpropanoid pathway and jasmonic acid biosynthesis was found at the inoculation site, when inoculations were compared with wounding. We found that transcriptional responses in inner sapwood were similar to those reported upon infection through the bark. Our data suggest that the defence mechanism is induced due to direct fungal contact irrespective of the tissue type. Understanding the nature of these interactions is important when considering tree breeding-based resistance strategies to reduce the spread of the pathogen between and within trees. </em></small><br>[ID: 26209615]"

Kooij PW, Aanen DK, Schiøtt M, Boomsma JJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Innovative evolutionary developments are often related to gene or genome duplications. The crop fungi of attine fungus-growing ants are suspected to have enhanced genetic variation reminiscent of polyploidy, but this has never been quantified with cytological data and genetic markers. We estimated the number of nuclei per fungal cell for 42 symbionts reared by 14 species of Panamanian fungus-growing ants. This showed that domesticated symbionts of higher attine ants are polykaryotic with 7-17 nuclei per cell, whereas nonspecialized crops of lower attines are dikaryotic similar to most free-living basidiomycete fungi. We then investigated how putative higher genetic diversity is distributed across polykaryotic mycelia, using microsatellite loci and evaluating models assuming that all nuclei are either heterogeneously haploid or homogeneously polyploid. Genetic variation in the polykaryotic symbionts of the basal higher attine genera Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex was only slightly enhanced, but the evolutionarily derived crop fungi of Atta and Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants had much higher genetic variation. Our opposite ploidy models indicated that the symbionts of Trachymyrmex and Sericomyrmex are likely to be lowly and facultatively polyploid (just over two haplotypes on average), whereas Atta and Acromyrmex symbionts are highly and obligatorily polyploid (ca. 5-7 haplotypes on average). This stepwise transition appears analogous to ploidy variation in plants and fungi domesticated by humans and in fungi domesticated by termites and plants, where gene or genome duplications were typically associated with selection for higher productivity, but allopolyploid chimerism was incompatible with sexual reproduction. </em></small><br>[ID: 26265100]"

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the lcc1 amino acid sequence is homologous to basidiomycete laccases and shares the highest similarity with Flammulina velutipes laccase. A 2021-bp promoter sequence containing a TATA box, CAAT box, and several putative cis-acting elements was also identified.

Additionally, primordium initiation was induced 3-5 days earlier in the transgenic fungus, and fruiting body maturation was also promoted approximately five days earlier than in the wt strain. Furthermore, we detected that lcc1 was sustainably overexpressed and that laccase activity was also higher in the transgenic strains compared with the wt strain during development in H. marmoreus.

In this study, 0.1% chlorfluazuron (CFZ) cellulose bait was tested against medium and large field colonies of Macrotermes gilvus (Hagen). The termite mounds were dissected to determine the health of the colony. Individual termites (i.e., workers and larvae) and fungus combs were subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to detect the presence of CFZ. In this study, 540.0 ± 25.8 g (or equivalent to 540.0 ± 25.8 mg active ingredient) and 680.0 ± 49.0 g (680.0 ± 49.0 mg active ingredient) of bait matrix were removed by the medium- and large-sized colonies, respectively, after baiting. All treated medium-sized colonies were moribund. The dead termites were scattered in the mound, larvae were absent, population size had decreased by 90%, and the queens appeared unhealthy. In contrast, no or limited effects were found in large-sized colonies. Only trace amounts of CFZ were detected in workers, larvae, and fungus combs, and the population of large-sized colonies had declined by only up to 40%. This might be owing to the presence of large amount of basidiomycete fungus and a drastic decrease of CFZ content per unit fungus comb (a main food source of larvae) in the large-sized colonies, and hence reduced the toxic effect and longer time is required to accumulate the lethal dose in larvae. Nevertheless, we do not deny the possibility of CSI bait eliminating or suppressing the higher termite if the test colonies could pick up adequate lethal dose by installing more bait stations and prolonging the baiting period.</em></small><br>[ID: 26470081]"

Zou L, Sun T, Li D, Tan Y, Zhang G, Wang F, Zhang J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Inonotus baumii, a basidiomycete white rot fungus, has been widely used as traditional herbal medicine in China, Korea, Japan and other Asian countries for many years. Its extract is of great medicinal importance and plays a valuable role in the immune response and disease resistance. However, limited genetic resources for I. baumii have hindered exploration of this species. In order to gain a molecular understanding of this fungus, Illumina high-throughput technology was used to sequence and analyze the transcriptome of I. baumii, and 280,691 contigs, 43,890 scaffolds and 30,051 unigenes were obtained. Additionally, based on similarity search with known proteins, unigenes were annotated with gene descriptions, gene ontology (GO), clusters of orthologous group (COG), and database of protein families (Pfam) terms. According to the annotation of unigenes, a total of 12 candidate genes involved in the triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway and 21 putative FOLymes (fungal oxidative lignin enzymes) and 176 CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes) were obtained using homology-based BlastX. Moreover, for better understanding of the transcripts function, the BlastX algorithm was used to search for homologous sequences against the Yeast genome. This is the first study on transcriptome analyses of I. baumii, which provided a dataset for functional gene mining and laid a basis for further functional genomics studies of I. baumii. </em></small><br>[ID: 26493632]"

Braesel J, Götze S, Shah F, Heine D, Tauber J, Hertweck C, Tunlid A, Stallforth P, Hoffmeister D<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The symbiotic fungus Paxillus involutus serves a critical role in maintaining forest ecosystems, which are carbon sinks of global importance. P. involutus produces involutin and other 2,5-diarylcyclopentenone pigments that presumably assist in the oxidative degradation of lignocellulose via Fenton chemistry. Their precise biosynthetic pathways, however, remain obscure. Using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses, in addition to stable-isotope labeling with synthetic precursors, we show that atromentin is the key intermediate. Atromentin is made by tridomain synthetases of high similarity: InvA1, InvA2, and InvA5. An inactive atromentin synthetase, InvA3, gained activity after a domain swap that replaced its native thioesterase domain with that of InvA5. The found degree of multiplex biosynthetic capacity is unprecedented with fungi, and highlights the great importance of the metabolite for the producer. </em></small><br>[ID: 26496685]"

Fruiting bodies of C. cinerea are typical mushrooms, which can be produced synchronously on defined media in the laboratory. To investigate the transcriptome in detail during fruiting body development, high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed using cDNA libraries strand-specifically constructed from 13 points (stages/tissues) with two biological replicates. The reads were aligned to 14,245 predicted transcripts, and counted for forward and reverse transcripts. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two adjacent points and between vegetative mycelium and each point were detected by Tag Count Comparison (TCC). To validate RNA-seq data, expression levels of selected genes were compared using RPKM values in RNA-seq data and qRT-PCR data, and DEGs detected in microarray data were examined in MA plots of RNA-seq data by TCC. We discuss events deduced from GO analysis of DEGs.

Langner T, Göhre V<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>In the past decades our knowledge about fungal cell wall architecture increased tremendously and led to the identification of many enzymes involved in polysaccharide synthesis and remodeling, which are also of biotechnological interest. Fungal cell walls play an important role in conferring mechanic stability during cell division and polar growth. Additionally, in phytopathogenic fungi the cell wall is the first structure that gets into intimate contact with the host plant. A major constituent of fungal cell walls is chitin, a homopolymer of N-acetylglucosamine units. To ensure plasticity, polymeric chitin needs continuous remodeling which is maintained by chitinolytic enzymes, including lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases N-acetylglucosaminidases, and chitinases. Depending on the species and lifestyle of fungi, there is great variation in the number of encoded chitinases and their function. Chitinases can have housekeeping function in plasticizing the cell wall or can act more specifically during cell separation, nutritional chitin acquisition, or competitive interaction with other fungi. Although chitinase research made huge progress in the last decades, our knowledge about their role in phytopathogenic fungi is still scarce. Recent findings in the dimorphic basidiomycete Ustilago maydis show that chitinases play different physiological functions throughout the life cycle and raise questions about their role during plant-fungus interactions. In this work we summarize these functions, mechanisms of chitinase regulation and their putative role during pathogen/host interactions. </em></small><br>[ID: 26527115]"

Andrade BS, Góes-Neto A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The filamentous fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa is a hemibiotrophic basidiomycete that causes witches' broom disease of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.). Many fungal mitochondrial plasmids are DNA and RNA polymerase-encoding invertrons with terminal inverted repeats and 5'-linked proteins. The aim of this study was to carry out comparative and phylogenetic analyses of DNA and RNA polymerases for all known linear mitochondrial plasmids in fungi. We performed these analyses at both gene and protein levels and assessed differences between fungal and viral polymerases in order to test the lateral gene transfer (LGT) hypothesis. We analyzed all mitochondrial plasmids of the invertron type within the fungal clade, including five from Ascomycota, seven from Basidiomycota, and one from Chytridiomycota. All phylogenetic analyses generated similar tree topologies regardless of the methods and datasets used. It is likely that DNA and RNA polymerase genes were inserted into the mitochondrial genomes of the 13 fungal species examined in our study as a result of different LGT events. These findings are important for a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships between fungal mitochondrial plasmids.</em></small><br>[ID: 26535725]"

Reddy MS, Kour M, Aggarwal S, Ahuja S, Marmeisse R, Fraissinet-Tachet L<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Metallothioneins (MTs) are small, cysteine-rich peptides involved in intracellular sequestration of heavy metals in eukaryotes. We examined the role in metal homeostasis and detoxification of an MT from the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus albus (PaMT1). PaMT1 encodes a 35 amino acid-long polypeptide, with 7 cysteine residues; most of them part of a C-x-C motif found in other known basidiomycete MTs. The expression levels of PaMT1 increased as a function of increased external Cu and Cd concentrations and were higher with Cu than with Cd. Heterologous complementation assays in metal-sensitive yeast mutants indicated that PaMT1 encodes a polypeptide capable of conferring higher tolerance to both Cu and Cd. Eucalyptus tereticornis plantlets colonized with P. albus grown in the presence of Cu and Cd showed better growth compared with those with non-mycorrhizal plants. Higher PaMT1 expression levels were recorded in mycorrhizal plants grown in the presence of Cu and Cd compared with those in control mycorrhizal plants not exposed to heavy metals. These data provide the first evidence to our knowledge that fungal MTs could protect ectomycorrhizal fungi from heavy metal stress and in turn help the plants to establish in metal-contaminated sites.</em></small><br>[ID: 26626627]"

Wagner K, Krause K, David A, Kai M, Jung EM, Sammer D, Kniemeyer O, Boland W, Kothe E<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Despite the rising interest in microbial communication, only few studies relate to mycorrhization and the pool of potential morphogenic substances produced by the surrounding soil community. Here, we investigated the effect exerted by the C18 - ketone β-apo-13-carotenone, D'orenone, on the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Tricholoma vaccinum and its symbiosis with the economically important host tree, spruce (Picea abies). D'orenone is an early intermediate in the biosynthesis of morphogens in sexual development of mucoromycetes, the trisporoids. In the ectomycorrhizal fungus T. vaccinum, D'orenone increased the production and/or release of the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) which had been proposed to be involved in the mutual symbiosis. The induced expression of the fungal aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald5 is associated with IAA synthesis and excretion. In the host tree, D'orenone modulated root architecture by increasing lateral root length and hypertrophy of root cortex cells, likely via changed IAA concentrations and flux. Thus, we report for the first time on carotenoid metabolites from soil fungi affecting both ectomycorrhizal partners. The data imply a complex network of functions for secondary metabolites which act in an inter-kingdom signalling in soil.</em></small><br>[ID: 26636983]"

In this work, we focused on cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) of D. squalens. The native CBHI fraction of the fungus, consisting three isoenzymes, was purified and it maintained the activity for 60 min at 50°C, and was stable in acidic pH. Due to the lack of enzyme activity assay for detecting only CBHII activity, CBHII of D. squalens was produced recombinantly in an industrially important ascomycete host, Trichoderma reesei. CBH enzymes of D. squalens showed potential in hydrolysis of complex lignocellulose substrates sugar beet pulp and wheat bran, and microcrystalline cellulose, Avicel. Recombinant CBHII (rCel6A) of D. squalens hydrolysed all the studied plant biomasses. Compared to individual activities, synergistic effect between rCel6A and native CBHI fraction of D. squalens was significant in the hydrolysis of Avicel. Furthermore, the addition of laccase to the mixture of CBHI fraction and rCel6A significantly enhanced the amount of released reducing sugars from sugar beet pulp. Especially, synergy between individual enzymes is a crucial factor in the tailor-made enzyme mixtures needed for hydrolysis of different plant biomass feedstocks. Our data supports the importance of oxidoreductases in improved enzyme cocktails for lignocellulose saccharification. </em></small><br>[ID: 26660105]"

The population genetic analyses revealed the existence of seven genetic groups in the past worldwide P. striiformis population. This genetic grouping generally corresponded with geographical sample origin except for the Middle East, where six of the seven genetic groups were represented. The presence of many genetic groups in the Middle Eastern population reflected a low differentiation from the populations in East Africa (FST=0.052) and in South Asia (FST=0.064).

Puypt1 contains the Rab1-Ypt1 conserved domain of small GTPase family and PuRas contains the fani acyl transferase enzyme catalytic site. According to the phylogenetic analysis all these four small GTPase clustered with basidiomycete group. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that Puypt1, PuRas and PuRhoA1 transcripts were significantly higher in the beginning of sclerotial formation than that in the mycelia, whereas the transcripts levels of PuRhoA2 gene were particularly lower in sclerotia than that in mycelia, suggesting that these four genes might be involved in P umbellatus selerotial development.</em></small><br>[ID: 26757558]"

However, little is known about how these factors act on the microbial community, and especially what role microbe-microbe interaction dynamics play.

We evaluated multiple potential factors of microbial community control: we sampled various wild A. thaliana populations at different times, performed field plantings with different host genotypes, and implemented successive host colonization experiments under lab conditions where abiotic factors, host genotype, and pathogen colonization was manipulated. Our results indicate that both abiotic factors and host genotype interact to affect plant colonization by all three groups of microbes. Considering microbe-microbe interactions, however, uncovered a network of interkingdom interactions with significant contributions to community structure. As in other scale-free networks, a small number of taxa, which we call microbial \"hubs,\" are strongly interconnected and have a severe effect on communities. By documenting these microbe-microbe interactions, we uncover an important mechanism explaining how abiotic factors and host genotypic signatures control microbial communities. In short, they act directly on \"hub\" microbes, which, via microbe-microbe interactions, transmit the effects to the microbial community. We analyzed two \"hub\" microbes (the obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogen Albugo and the basidiomycete yeast fungus Dioszegia) more closely. Albugo had strong effects on epiphytic and endophytic bacterial colonization. Specifically, alpha diversity decreased and beta diversity stabilized in the presence of Albugo infection, whereas they otherwise varied between plants. Dioszegia, on the other hand, provided evidence for direct hub interaction with phyllosphere bacteria. The identification of microbial \"hubs\" and their importance in phyllosphere microbiome structuring has crucial implications for plant-pathogen and microbe-microbe research and opens new entry points for ecosystem management and future targeted biocontrol. The revelation that effects can cascade through communities via \"hub\" microbes is important to understand community structure perturbations in parallel fields including human microbiomes and bioprocesses. In particular, parallels to human microbiome \"keystone\" pathogens and microbes open new avenues of interdisciplinary research that promise to better our understanding of functions of host-associated microbiomes. </em></small><br>[ID: 26788878]"

CBMAI 1063 was investigated in relation to Reactive Black 5 (RB5) dye decolorization and degradation using an integrated statistical design composed of Plackett-Burman design (P&B), central composite design (CCD), and response surface methodology (RSM). RB5 dye was effectively decolorized (94 %) in saline conditions, without any detection of mutagenic compounds, and simultaneously, 57 % of total organic carbon (TOC) was removed in 7 days. The activity of lignin peroxidase (LiP) was not detected during the process. The gene expression of laccase (Lac) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) enzymes produced during the process was evaluated, and results from this experiment coupled with LC-MS analyses revealed that in the early stage of dye decolorization, a higher MnP gene expression and significant enzymatic activity was detected in Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063 with the formation of p-Base and TAHNDS compounds. This paper reports innovative data related to the textile dye decolorization by the marine-derived basidiomycete Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063, showing the metabolites formed and enzymatic action throughout the process in saline condition. The strategy used showed to be an efficient statistical approach that provides an attractive solution for the screening and simultaneous optimization of the degradation process. </em></small><br>[ID: 26797957]"

Zhou B, Bailey A, Niblett CL, Qu R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Transgenic tall fescue plants expressing RNAi constructs of essential genes of Rhizoctonia solani were resistant to R. solani. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is an important turf and forage grass species widely used for home lawns and on golf courses in North Carolina and other transition zone states in the US. The most serious and frequently occurring disease of tall fescue is brown patch, caused by a basidiomycete fungus, Rhizoctonia solani. This research demonstrates resistance to brown patch disease achieved by the application of host induced gene silencing. We transformed tall fescue with RNAi constructs of four experimentally determined \"essential\" genes from R. solani (including genes encoding RNA polymerase, importin beta-1 subunit, Cohesin complex subunit Psm1, and a ubiquitin E3 ligase) to suppress expression of those genes inside the fungus and thus inhibit fungal infection. Four gene constructs were tested, and 19 transgenic plants were obtained, among which 12 plants had detectable accumulation of siRNAs of the target genes. In inoculation tests, six plants displayed significantly improved resistance against R. solani. Lesion size was reduced by as much as 90 %. Plants without RNAi accumulation did not show resistance. To our knowledge, this is the first case that RNAi constructs of pathogen genes introduced into a host plant can confer resistance against a necrotrophic fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 26800976]"

Histopathologically, numerous hyphae were seen in granulomatous lesions in the eyes, lung, heart, and lymph nodules. An isolate on potato dextrose agar from the eyes, lung, and sputum yielded a rapidly growing white woolly mycelia with basidiocarps (fruiting bodies) at 37°C. A suitable temperature for mycelial growth was obtained at 25°C, although sustained growth also occurred at 37°C. The fungal isolate, KH-JPN15-011, had distinctive features including hyphae bearing spicules and clamp connections, which were consistent with the characteristics of basidiomycete fungus. The sequence of the internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA showed 99.67% (617 bp) similarity with those of S. commune Phylogenetic analysis showed that the present isolate is most closely related to the samples from the Old World. This is the first report of a fatal disease caused by S. commune in exotic animals. Previously reported human and canine infections have not included granulomatous endophthalmitis and myocarditis.

Rafter M, Yokoya K, Schofield EJ, Zettler LW, Sarasan V<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Orchids, particularly terrestrial taxa, rely mostly on basidiomycete fungi in the Cantharellales and Sebacinales that trigger the process of seed germination and/or initiate the full development of the seedling. During the course of development, orchids may associate with the same fungus, or they may enlist other types of fungi for their developmental needs leading to resilience in a natural setting. This study examined in vitro seed germination and seedling developmental behavior of Cynorkis purpurea, a terrestrial orchid from the Central Highlands of Madagascar. This species is mostly restricted to gallery forests in the Itremo Massif, in moist substrate between rocks bordering streams. The main objective was to understand the influence of diverse mycorrhizal fungi on seed germination and further development of C. purpurea. The study aims to compare symbiotic versus asymbiotic germination and seedling development with seeds and fungi collected from a 13-km(2) area in the Itremo region. Seeds collected from the wild were sown with diverse orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) spanning 12 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in three genera (Tulasnella, Ceratobasidium, and Sebacina) acquired from different habitats. Treatments were assessed in terms of the percentage of germinated seeds and fully developed seedlings against those in asymbiotic control media treatments. Overall, OMF significantly improved seedling development within the 12-week experiment period. Sebacina as a genus was the most effective at promoting seedling development of C. purpurea, as well as having the ability to enter into successful symbiotic relationships with orchids of different life forms; this new knowledge may be especially useful for orchid conservation practiced in tropical areas like Madagascar. A Sebacina isolate from an epiphytic seedling of Polystachya concreta was the most effective at inducing rapid seedling development and was among the five that outperformed fungi isolated from roots of C. purpurea. C. purpurea was found to be a mycorrhizal generalist, despite its specific habitat preference, highlighting the complex interaction between the plant, fungi, and the environment. The potential impact on conservation strategies of understanding the requirements for orchid seed germination and development by identifying and using OMF from diverse sources is discussed in detail. </em></small><br>[ID: 26984810]"

Functional annotation revealed unknown functions (37.2%), glycosyl hydrolases (26.5%) and redox enzymes (11.5%) as the main groups in the two strains.

Bonneville S, Bray AW, Benning LG<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Microorganisms are essential agents of Earth's soil weathering engine who help transform primary rock-forming minerals into soils. Mycorrhizal fungi, with their vast filamentous networks in symbiosis with the roots of most plants can alter a large number of minerals via local acidification, targeted excretion of ligands, submicron-scale biomechanical forcing, and mobilization of Mg, Fe, Al, and K at the hypha-biotite interface. Here, we present experimental evidence that Paxillus involutus-a basidiomycete fungus-in ectomycorrhizal symbiosis with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), is able to oxidize a substantial amount of structural Fe(II) in biotite. Iron redox chemistry, quantified by X-ray absorption near edge spectra on 13 fungi-biotite sections along three distinct hypha colonizing the [001] basal plane of biotite, revealed variable but extensive Fe(II) oxidation up to ∼2 μm in depth and a Fe(III)/Fetotal ratio of up to ∼0.8. The growth of Fe(III) hydroxide implies a volumetric change and a strain within the biotite lattice potentially large enough to induce microcrack formation, which are abundant below the hypha-biotite interface. This Fe(II) oxidation also leads to the formation of a large pool of Fe(III) (i.e., structural Fe(III) and Fe(III) oxyhydroxides) within biotite that could participate in the Fe redox cycling in soils.</em></small><br>[ID: 27128742]"

Armitage SA, Fernández-Marín H, Boomsma JJ, Wcislo WT<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungus-growing ants (Attini) have evolved an obligate dependency upon a basidiomycete fungus that they cultivate as their food. Less well known is that the crop fungus is also used by many attine species to cover their eggs, larvae and pupae. The adaptive functional significance of this brood covering is poorly understood. One hypothesis to account for this behaviour is that it is part of the pathogen protection portfolio when many thousands of sister workers live in close proximity and larvae and pupae are not protected by cells, as in bees and wasps, and are immobile. We performed behavioural observations on brood covering in the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior, and we experimentally manipulated mycelial cover on pupae and exposed them to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum to test for a role in pathogen resistance. Our results show that active mycelial brood covering by workers is a behaviourally plastic trait that varies temporally, and across life stages and castes. The presence of a fungal cover on the pupae reduced the rate at which conidia appeared and the percentage of pupal surface that produced pathogen spores, compared to pupae that had fungal cover experimentally removed or naturally had no mycelial cover. Infected pupae with mycelium had higher survival rates than infected pupae without the cover, although this depended upon the time at which adult sister workers were allowed to interact with pupae. Finally, workers employed higher rates of metapleural gland grooming to infected pupae without mycelium than to infected pupae with mycelium. Our results imply that mycelial brood covering may play a significant role in suppressing the growth and subsequent spread of disease, thus adding a novel layer of protection to their defence portfolio.</em></small><br>[ID: 27136600]"

In this study, an AAO was heterologously expressed in a basidiomycete host for the first time. The gene for an AAO of the white-rot fungus Pleurotus sapidus, a close relative to the oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus, was cloned into an expression vector and put under control of the promotor of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene 2 (gpdII) of the button mushroom Agaricus bisporus. The expression vector was transformed into the model basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea, and several positive transformants were obtained. The best producing transformants were grown in shake-flasks and in a stirred tank reactor reaching enzymatic activities of up to 125 U L(-1) using veratryl alcohol as a substrate. The purified AAO was biochemically characterized and compared to the previously described native and recombinant AAOs from other Pleurotus species.

Hatakeyama M, Kitaoka T, Ichinose H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cytochromes P450 from the white-rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium, CYP5136A1 and CYP5136A3, are capable of catalyzing oxygenation reactions of a wide variety of exogenous compounds, implying their significant roles in the metabolism of xenobiotics by the fungus. It is therefore interesting to explore their biochemistry to better understand fungal biology and to enable the use of fungal enzymes in the biotechnology sector. In the present study, we developed heterologous expression systems for CYP5136A1 and CYP5136A3 using the T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system in Escherichia coli. Expression levels of recombinant P450s were dramatically improved by modifications and optimization of their N-terminal amino acid sequences. A CYP5136A1 reaction system was reconstructed in E. coli whole cells by coexpression of CYP5136A1 and a redox partner, NADPH-dependent P450 reductase (CPR). The catalytic activity of CYP5136A1 was significantly increased when cytochrome b5 (Cyt-b5) was further coexpressed with CPR, indicating that Cyt-b5 supports electron transfer reactions from NAD(P)H to CYP5136A1. Notably, P450 reaction occurred in E. coli cells that harbored CYP5136A1 and Cyt-b5 but not CPR, implying that the reducing equivalents required for the P450 catalytic cycle were transferred via a CPR-independent pathway. Such an \"alternative\" electron transfer system in CYP5136A1 reaction was also demonstrated using purified enzymes in vitro. The fungal P450 reaction system may be associated with sophisticated electron transfer pathways. </em></small><br>[ID: 27233123]"

Changes in intracellular redox potential can cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress due to diminished efficiency in protein folding that could in turn reduce cell survival. Such stress diminishes protein-folding efficiency that could in turn reduce cell survival. Light microscopy revealed morphological changes in hyphae after TM but not after DTT treatment, regardless of the media carbon source.

Electron microscopy showed TM and DDT-induced ER stress in M. perniciosa as evidenced by structural alterations of the organelle. The volume of ER structures increased as a typical consequence of unfolded protein stress, and the number of autophagosomes was higher.

A previous genetic study indicated that the resistance of Norway spruce (Picea abies) to Heterobasidion annosum s.l., a pathogenic basidiomycete species complex, is linked to a quantitative trait loci that associates with differences in fungal growth in sapwood (FGS) that includes a gene, PaLAR3, which encodes a leucoanthocyanidin reductase. In this study, gene sequences showed the presence of two PaLAR3 allelic lineages in P. abies. Higher resistance was associated with the novel allele, which was found in low frequency in the four P. abies populations that we studied. Norway spruce plants carrying at least one copy of the novel allele showed a significant reduction in FGS after inoculation with Heterobasidion parviporum compared to their half-siblings carrying no copies, indicating dominance of this allele. The amount of (+) catechin, the enzymatic product of PaLAR3, was significantly higher in bark of trees homozygous for the novel allele. Although we observed that the in vitro activities of the enzymes encoded by the two alleles were similar, we could show that allele-specific transcript levels were significantly higher for the novel allele, indicating that regulation of gene expression is responsible for the observed effects in resistance, possibly caused by differences in cis-acting elements that we observe in the promoter region of the two alleles.</em></small><br>[ID: 27317690]"

Tollot M, Assmann D, Becker C, Altmüller J, Dutheil JY, Wegner CE, Kahmann R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The biotrophic basidiomycete fungus Ustilago maydis causes smut disease in maize. Hallmarks of the disease are large tumors that develop on all aerial parts of the host in which dark pigmented teliospores are formed. We have identified a member of the WOPR family of transcription factors, Ros1, as major regulator of spore formation in U. maydis. ros1 expression is induced only late during infection and hence Ros1 is neither involved in plant colonization of dikaryotic fungal hyphae nor in plant tumor formation. However, during late stages of infection Ros1 is essential for fungal karyogamy, massive proliferation of diploid fungal cells and spore formation. Premature expression of ros1 revealed that Ros1 counteracts the b-dependent filamentation program and induces morphological alterations resembling the early steps of sporogenesis. Transcriptional profiling and ChIP-seq analyses uncovered that Ros1 remodels expression of about 30% of all U. maydis genes with 40% of these being direct targets. In total the expression of 80 transcription factor genes is controlled by Ros1. Four of the upregulated transcription factor genes were deleted and two of the mutants were affected in spore development. A large number of b-dependent genes were differentially regulated by Ros1, suggesting substantial changes in this regulatory cascade that controls filamentation and pathogenic development. Interestingly, 128 genes encoding secreted effectors involved in the establishment of biotrophic development were downregulated by Ros1 while a set of 70 \"late effectors\" was upregulated. These results indicate that Ros1 is a master regulator of late development in U. maydis and show that the biotrophic interaction during sporogenesis involves a drastic shift in expression of the fungal effectome including the downregulation of effectors that are essential during early stages of infection.</em></small><br>[ID: 27332891]"

The interest in this fungus derives from its capacity to establish a symbiosis with tree roots, thereby playing a major role in nutrient cycling of forest ecosystems. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is a highly complex interaction involving many genes from both partners. To advance in the functional characterization of fungal genes, AMT was used on a monokaryotic L. bicolor. A collection of over 1200 transgenic strains was produced, of which 200 randomly selected strains were analyzed for their genomic T-DNA insertion patterns. By means of insertional mutagenesis, a number of transgenic strains were obtained displaying differential growth features. Moreover, mating with a compatible strain resulted in dikaryons that retained altered phenotypic features of the transgenic monokaryon. The analysis of the T-DNA integration pattern revealed mostly similar results to those reported in earlier studies, confirming the usefulness of AMT on different genetic backgrounds of L. bicolor. Taken together, our studies display the great versatility and potentiality of AMT as a tool for the genetic characterization of L. bicolor.</em></small><br>[ID: 27387518]"

The hemibiotrophic basidiomycete Moniliophthora perniciosa is the causal agent of witches' broom disease of Theobroma cacao L.

It has been hypothesized that M. perniciosa pathogenesis involves PCD, initially as a plant defence mechanism, which is diverted by the fungus to induce necrosis during the dikaryotic phase of the mycelia. Here, we evaluated whether the expression of a cacao anti-apoptotic gene would affect the incidence and severity of M. perniciosa infection using the 'Micro-Tom' (MT) tomato as a model. The cacao Bax-inhibitor-1 (TcBI-1) gene, encoding a putative basal attenuator of PCD, was constitutively expressed in MT to evaluate function.

When the same transformants were inoculated with the necrotrophic fungal pathogens Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Sclerotium rolfsii and Botrytis cinerea, a significant reduction in infection severity was observed, confirming TcBI-1 function. After inoculation with M. perniciosa, TcBI-1 transformant lines showed a significant reduction in disease incidence compared with MT. The overexpression of TcBI-1 appears to affect the ability of germinating spores to penetrate susceptible tissues, restoring part of the non-host resistance in MT against the S-biotype of M. perniciosa.</em></small><br>[ID: 27454588]"

Kaur J, Fellers J, Adholeya A, Velivelli SL, El-Mounadi K, Nersesian N, Clemente T, Shah D<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Rust fungi of the order Pucciniales are destructive pathogens of wheat worldwide. Leaf rust caused by the obligate, biotrophic basidiomycete fungus Puccinia triticina (Pt) is an economically important disease capable of causing up to 50 % yield losses. Historically, resistant wheat cultivars have been used to control leaf rust, but genetic resistance is ephemeral and breaks down with the emergence of new virulent Pt races. There is a need to develop alternative measures for control of leaf rust in wheat. Development of transgenic wheat expressing an antifungal defensin offers a promising approach to complement the endogenous resistance genes within the wheat germplasm for durable resistance to Pt. To that end, two different wheat genotypes, Bobwhite and Xin Chun 9 were transformed with a chimeric gene encoding an apoplast-targeted antifungal plant defensin MtDEF4.2 from Medicago truncatula. Transgenic lines from four independent events were further characterized. Homozygous transgenic wheat lines expressing MtDEF4.2 displayed resistance to Pt race MCPSS relative to the non-transgenic controls in growth chamber bioassays. Histopathological analysis suggested the presence of both pre- and posthaustorial resistance to leaf rust in these transgenic lines. MtDEF4.2 did not, however, affect the root colonization of a beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. This study demonstrates that the expression of apoplast-targeted plant defensin MtDEF4.2 can provide substantial resistance to an economically important leaf rust disease in transgenic wheat without negatively impacting its symbiotic relationship with the beneficial mycorrhizal fungus.</em></small><br>[ID: 27582300]"

Lashermes G, Gainvors-Claisse A, Recous S, Bertrand I<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Soil microorganisms can control the soil cycles of carbon (C), and depending on their C-use efficiency (CUE), these microorganisms either contribute to C stabilization in soil or produce CO2 when decomposing organic matter. However, little is known regarding the enzyme investment of microbial decomposers and the effects on their CUE. Our objective was to elucidate the strategies of litter-decomposing fungi as a function of litter quality. Fungal biosynthesis and respiration were accounted for by quantifying the investment in enzyme synthesis and enzyme efficiency. The basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium was grown on the leaves, stems, and roots of maize over 126 days in controlled conditions. We periodically measured the fungal biomass, enzyme activity, and chemical composition of the remaining litter and continuously measured the evolved C-CO2. The CUE observed for the maize litter was highest in the leaves (0.63), intermediate in the roots (0.40), and lowest in the stems (0.38). However, the enzyme efficiency and investment in enzyme synthesis did not follow the same pattern. The amount of litter C decomposed per mole of C-acquiring hydrolase activity was 354 μg C in the leaves, 246 μg C in the roots, and 1541 μg C in the stems (enzyme efficiency: stems > leaves > roots). The fungus exhibited the highest investment in C-acquiring enzyme when grown on the roots and produced 40-80% less enzyme activity when grown on the stems and leaves (investment in enzymes: roots > leaves > stems). The CUE was dependent on the initial availability and replenishment of the soluble substrate fraction with the degradation products. The production of these compounds was either limited because of the low enzyme efficiency, which occurred in the roots, or because of the low investments in enzyme synthesis, which occurred in the stems. Fungal biosynthesis relied on the ability of the fungus to invest in enzyme synthesis and the efficient interactions between the enzymes and the substrate. The investment decreased when N was limited, whereas the efficiency of the C-acquiring enzymes was primarily explained by the hemicellulose content and its embedment in recalcitrant lignin linkages. Our results are crucial for modeling microbial allocation strategies. </em></small><br>[ID: 27617006]"

Wu FL, Zhang G, Ren A, Dang ZH, Shi L, Jiang AL, Zhao MW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ganoderma lucidum is a medicinal macrofungus that is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. Nonetheless, the scarcity of basic biological studies of this organism has hindered the further development of its commercial value. The pH-responsive transcription factor PacC/Rim101 governs the adaptation to environmental pH, the development and the secondary metabolism of many fungi. In this study, a homologue of PacC/Rim101 that encodes GlPacC was identified in the higher basidiomycete G. lucidum. GlPacC is composed of 807 amino acids and contains three typical C2H2 zinc-finger domains, two potential PEST domains, a putative PKA phosphorylation site, and a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS). GlPacC was transcribed at a high level when the fungus was under neutral and alkaline conditions, and silencing of GlPacC impaired the fungal response to ambient pH. The distance between the hyphal branches (of vegetative hyphae and aerial hyphae) was significantly increased in the GlPacC-silenced strains. The GlPacC-silenced strains grew abnormally or became sickly on solid culture medium and were unable to form primordia and fruiting bodies. The ganoderic acid content, levels of the sqs and ls transcripts, and contents of the metabolic intermediates squalene and lanosterol were all up-regulated in the GlPacC-silenced strains. Our results indicate that GlPacC is functional and plays complex roles in mycelial growth, fruiting body development and ganoderic acid biosynthesis in G. lucidum.</em></small><br>[ID: 27760853]"

Laccases have wide substrate specificity, oxidize a broad range of compounds, and show potential for use in dye decolorization. We evaluated laccase production in a recently isolated strain of P. sanguineus cultivated with sugarcane molasses as the only carbon source, and urea or yeast extract as the nitrogen source [at various nitrogen concentrations (0.4, 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4 g/L)], supplemented with copper (0, 150, 200, 250, and 300 µM), with or without agitation. The enzymatic extract produced at laccase peak activity was tested for dye decolorization capability on Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Reactive Black 5, Reactive Red 195, and Reactive Yellow 145. The nitrogen source did not affect enzyme production and the higher nitrogen concentration (3.4 g/L nitrogen as urea) increased enzymatic activity. The addition of up to 300 µM of Cu did not affect laccase production, whereas cultivation with agitation increased the activity peak by 17%. The highest laccase activity was ~50,000 U/L on the ninth day of cultivation. After 24 h, decolorization was 80% for Remazol Brilliant Blue R, 9% for Reactive Yellow 145, 6% for Reactive Red 195, and 2% for Reactive Black 5. The enzymatic extract of P. sanguineus provides a potential alternative to wastewater treatment.

Ostrowski LA, Saville BJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete smut fungus Ustilago maydis causes common smut of corn. This disease is spread through the production of teliospores, which are thick-walled dormant structures characterized by low rates of respiration and metabolism. Teliospores are formed when the fungus grows within the plant, and the morphological steps involved in their formation have been described, but the molecular events leading to dormancy are not known. In U. maydis, natural antisense transcripts (NATs) can function to alter gene expression and many NATs have increased levels in the teliospore. One such NAT is as-ssm1 which is complementary to the gene for the mitochondrial seryl-tRNA synthetase (ssm1), an enzyme important to mitochondrial function. The disruption of ssm1 leads to cell lysis, indicating it is also essential for cellular viability. To assess the function of as-ssm1, it was ectopically expressed in haploid cells, where it is not normally present. This expression led to reductions in growth rate, virulence, mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption. It also resulted in the formation of as-ssm1/ssm1 double-stranded RNA and increased ssm1 transcript levels, but no change in Ssm1 protein levels was detected. Together, these findings suggest a role for as-ssm1 in facilitating teliospore dormancy through dsRNA formation and reduction of mitochondrial function.</em></small><br>[ID: 27888605]"

Graf MM, Weber S, Kracher D, Kittl R, Sygmund C, Ludwig R, Peterbauer C, Haltrich D<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Multigenicity is commonly found in fungal enzyme systems, with the purpose of functional compensation upon deficiency of one of its members or leading to enzyme isoforms with new functionalities through gene diversification. Three genes of the flavin-dependent glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductase pyranose dehydrogenase (AmPDH) were previously identified in the litter-degrading fungus Agaricus (Leucoagaricus) meleagris, of which only AmPDH1 was successfully expressed and characterized. The aim of this work was to study the biophysical and biochemical properties of AmPDH2 and AmPDH3 and compare them with those of AmPDH1. AmPDH1, AmPDH2 and AmPDH3 showed negligible oxygen reactivity and possess a covalently tethered FAD cofactor. All three isoforms can oxidise a range of different monosaccarides and oligosaccharides including glucose, mannose, galactose and xylose, which are the main constituent sugars of cellulose and hemicelluloses, and judging from the apparent steady-state kinetics determined for these sugars, the three isoforms do not show significant differences pertaining to their reaction with sugar substrates. They oxidize glucose both at C2 and C3 and upon prolonged reaction C2 and C3 double-oxidized glucose is obtained, confirming that the A. meleagris genes pdh2 (AY753308.1) and pdh3 (DQ117577.1) indeed encode CAZy class AA3_2 pyranose dehydrogenases. While reactivity with electron donor substrates was comparable for the three AmPDH isoforms, their kinetic properties differed significantly for the model electron acceptor substrates tested, a radical (the 2,2'-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid] cation radical), a quinone (benzoquinone) and a complexed iron ion (the ferricenium ion). Thus, a possible explanation for this PDH multiplicity in A. meleagris could be that different isoforms react preferentially with structurally different electron acceptors in vivo.</em></small><br>[ID: 27995309]"

We examined the ability of Actinobacteria isolated from termite guts in suppressing microorganisms commonly encountered in a subterranean environment. Guts from two subterranean termite species, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) and Reticulitermes tibialis Banks, were extracted and plated on selective chitin media. A total of 38 Actinobacteria isolates were selected for in vitro growth inhibition assays. Target microbes included three strains of Serratia marcescens Bizio, two mold fungi (Trichoderma sp. and Metarhizium sp.), a yeast fungus (Candida albicans (C.P. Robin) Berkhout), and four basidiomycete fungi (Gloeophyllum trabeum (Persoon) Murrill, Tyromyces palustris (Berkeley & M.A. Curtis) Murrill, Irpex lacteus (Fries) Fries, and Trametes versicolor (L.) Lloyd). Results showed both broad and narrow ranges of antimicrobial activity against the mold fungi, yeast fungus, and S. marcescens isolates by the Actinobacteria selected. This suggests that termite gut-associated Actinobacteria produce secondary antimicrobial compounds that may be important for pathogen inhibition in termites. Basidiomycete fungi were strongly inhibited by the selected Actinobacteria isolates, with G. trabeum and T. versicolor being most inhibited, followed by I. lacteus and T. palustris The degree of inhibition was correlated with shifts in pH caused by the Actinobacteria. Nearly all Actinobacteria isolates raised pH of the growth medium to basic levels (i.e. pH ∼8.0-9.5). We summarize antimicrobial activity of these termite gut-associated Actinobacteria and examine the implications of these pH shifts.</em></small><br>[ID: 28028088]"

White-rot basidiomycete fungi also live in a specific habitat, as they are found exclusively in wood. In this study, we evaluated how well the enzymatic machinery of the white-rot fungus Dichomitus squalens is tailored to degrade its natural wood substrate. The transcriptome and exoproteome of D. squalens were analyzed after cultivation on two natural substrates, aspen and spruce wood, and two non-woody substrates, wheat bran and cotton seed hulls. D. squalens produced ligninolytic enzymes mainly at the early time point of the wood cultures, indicating the need to degrade lignin to get access to wood polysaccharides. Surprisingly, the response of the fungus to the non-woody polysaccharides was nearly as good a match to the substrate composition as observed for the wood polysaccharides.

We used an extensive sampling strategy to investigate whether similar viruses occur in more than one fungal species of the same forest habitat. Mycelial samples were collected from in-growth mesh bags (N = 259), fruiting bodies (N = 173) and cultured isolates (N = 68) at a forest site where the spatial distribution of viral infections in clonal individuals of the wood decay fungus Heterobasidion parviporum was mapped in detail earlier. The investigation revealed previously known Heterobasidion viruses in ∼2% of the single or pooled mycorrhizal samples from mesh bags, ∼3% of the fruiting body samples and none of the fungal cultures analyzed. Novel virus strains distinct from known Heterobasidion viruses were detected in cultures of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Lactarius tabidus, L. rufus) and saprotrophic fungi (Megacollybia platyphylla, Mucoraceae spp.). Overall, our results support the view that mycoviruses do not readily cross species borders.

Additionally, they may also be involved in the interaction between H. annosum and P. gigantea. A genome-wide analysis of CYPs in Heterobasidion irregulare was carried out alongside gene expression studies. According to the Standardized CYP Nomenclature criteria, the H. irregulare genome has 121 CYP genes and 17 CYP pseudogenes classified into 11 clans, 35 families, and 64 subfamilies. Tandem CYP arrays originating from gene duplications and belonging to the same family and subfamily were found. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the families of H. irregulare CYPs were monophyletic groups except for the family CYP5144. Microarray analysis revealed the transcriptional pattern for 130 transcripts of CYP-encoding genes during growth on culture filtrate produced by P. gigantea. The high level of P450 gene diversity identified in this study could result from extensive gene duplications presumably caused by the high metabolic demands of H. irregulare in its ecological niches.</em></small><br>[ID: 28089047]"

Liu T, Li H, Ding Y, Qi Y, Gao Y, Song A, Shen J, Qiu L<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Dikarya is a subkingdom of fungi that includes Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The gene expression patterns of dikaryon are poorly understood. In this study, we bred a dikaryon DK13×3 by mating monokaryons MK13 and MK3, which were from the basidiospores of Pleurotus ostreatus TD300. Using RNA-Seq, we obtained the transcriptomes of the three strains. We found that the total transcript numbers in the transcriptomes of the three strains were all more than ten thousand, and the expression profile in DK13×3 was more similar to MK13 than MK3. However, the genes involved in macromolecule utilization, cellular material synthesis, stress-resistance and signal transduction were much more up-regulated in the dikaryon than its constituent monokaryons. All possible modes of differential gene expression, when compared to constituent monokaryons, including the presence/absence variation, and additivity/nonadditivity gene expression in the dikaryon may contribute to heterosis. By sequencing the urease gene poure sequences and mRNA sequences, we identified the monoallelic expression of the poure gene in the dikaryon, and its transcript was from the parental monokaryon MK13. Furthermore, we discovered RNA editing in the poure gene mRNA of the three strains.

According to structural analysis, amino acid similarities and conservation of particular motifs, it was established that this enzyme belongs to the (HSL) family. The cDNA sequence consisted of 969 nucleotides, while the gene comprised 1133, including three introns of 57, 50, and 57 nucleotides. Through three-dimensional modeling and phylogenetic analysis, we conclude that BaEstB is an ortholog of the previously described RmEstB-HSL from the phylogenetically distant fungus Rhizomucor miehei. The purified BaEstB was characterized in terms of its specificity for the hydrolysis of different acyl substrates confirming its low lipolytic activity and a noticeable esterase activity. The biochemical characterization of BaEstB, the DLS analysis and the kinetic parameters determination revealed this enzyme as a true esterase, preferentially found in a dimeric state, displaying activity under alkaline conditions and relative low temperature (pH = 10, 20°C). Our data suggest that BaEstB is more active on substrates with short acyl chains and bulky aromatic moieties. Phylogenetic data allow us to suggest that a number of fungal hypothetical proteins could belong to the HSL family.</em></small><br>[ID: 28251842]"

This study aimed to identify potential heavy metal chelators in S. luteus. Two metallothionein (MT) coding genes, SlMTa and SlMTb, were identified. When heterologously expressed in yeast, both SlMTa and SlMTb can rescue the Cu sensitive mutant from Cu toxicity. In S. luteus, transcription of both SlMTa and SlMTb is induced by Cu but not Cd or Zn. Several putative Cu-sensing and metal-response elements are present in the promoter sequences. These results indicate that SlMTa and SlMTb function as Cu-thioneins. Homologs of the S. luteus MTs are present in 49 species belonging to 10 different orders of the subphylum Agaricomycotina and are remarkably conserved. The length of the proteins, number and distribution of cysteine residues indicate a novel family of fungal MTs. The ubiquitous and highly conserved features of these MTs suggest that they are important for basic cellular functions in species in the subphylum Agaricomycotina.</em></small><br>[ID: 28276186]"

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the basidiocarp development by the fungus, we proceeded to analyze the transcriptome of the process, identifying a total of 2002 and 1064 differentially expressed genes at two developmental stages, young and mature basidiocarps, respectively. Function of these genes was analyzed with the use of different databases. MIPS analysis revealed that in the stage of young basidiocarp, among the ca. two thousand differentially expressed genes, there were some previously described for basidiocarp development in other fungal species. Additional elements that operated at this stage included, among others, genes encoding the transcription factors FOXO3, MIG3, PRO1, TEC1, copper and MFS transporters, and cytochromes P450. During mature basidiocarp development, important up-regulated genes included those encoding hydrophobins, laccases, and ferric reductase (FRE/NOX). The demonstration that a mapkk mutant was unable to form basidiocarps, indicated the importance of the MAPK signaling pathway in this developmental process.</em></small><br>[ID: 28285895]"

Vasina DV, Moiseenko KV, Fedorova TV, Tyazhelova TV<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ligninolytic heme peroxidases comprise an extensive family of enzymes, which production is characteristic for white-rot Basidiomycota. The majority of fungal heme peroxidases are encoded by multigene families that differentially express closely related proteins. Currently, there were very few attempts to characterize the complete multigene family of heme peroxidases in a single fungus. Here we are focusing on identification and characterization of peroxidase genes, which are transcribed and secreted by basidiomycete Trametes hirsuta 072, an efficient lignin degrader. The T. hirsuta genome contains 18 ligninolytic peroxidase genes encoding 9 putative lignin peroxidases (LiP), 7 putative short manganese peroxidases (MnP) and 2 putative versatile peroxidases (VP). Using ddPCR method we have quantified the absolute expression of the 18 peroxidase genes under different culture conditions and on different growth stages of basidiomycete. It was shown that only two genes (one MnP and one VP) were prevalently expressed as well as secreted into cultural broth under all conditions investigated. However their transcriptome and protein profiles differed in time depending on the effector used. The expression of other peroxidase genes revealed a significant variability, so one can propose the specific roles of these enzymes in fungal development and lifestyle.</em></small><br>[ID: 28301519]"

Das A, Bhattacharya S, Palaniswamy M, Angayarkanni J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) produced by Aspergillus flavus is known to have carcinogenic and teratogenic effects on animal health. Accidental feeding of AFB1-contaminated rice straw may be detrimental to dairy cattle. White-rot basidiomycetous fungus Pleurotus ostreatus can grow on different agronomic wastes by synthesizing different ligninolytic enzymes. These extracellular enzymes are capable of degrading many environmentally hazardous compounds including AFB1. The present study examines the ability of different strains of P. ostreatus to degrade AFB1 in contaminated rice straw. Different strains of A. flavus were inoculated on rice straw for AFB1 production. The moldy straw was then subjected to co-cultivation by different strains of P. ostreatus. The extent of AFB1 degradation was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Results indicated the presence of AFB1 in the moldy straw samples at levels of 27.95 ± 0.23 and 21.26 ± 0.55 µg/g of dry substrate for A. flavus MTCC 2798 and A. flavus GHBF09, respectively. Co-cultivation of P. ostreatus strains on AFB1-contaminated rice straw revealed their ability to rapidly colonize the substrate by profuse hyphal ramification. Highest degradation of AFB1 (89.41 %) was recorded in the straw containing co-cultures of A. flavus MTCC 2798 and P. ostreatus GHBBF10. Natural isolate P. ostreatus GHBBF10 demonstrated higher AFB1-degradation potential than P.ostreatus MTCC 142. This basidiomycete strain can be further exploited to effectively degrade moderate concentrations of AFB1 in contaminated moldy rice straw.</em></small><br>[ID: 28324293]"

Chow EW, Clancey SA, Billmyre RB, Averette AF, Granek JA, Mieczkowski P, Cardenas ME, Heitman J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Calcineurin is a highly conserved Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase that orchestrates cellular Ca2+ signaling responses. In Cryptococcus neoformans, calcineurin is activated by multiple stresses including high temperature, and is essential for stress adaptation and virulence. The transcription factor Crz1 is a major calcineurin effector in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi. Calcineurin dephosphorylates Crz1, thereby enabling Crz1 nuclear translocation and transcription of target genes. Here we show that loss of Crz1 confers phenotypes intermediate between wild-type and calcineurin mutants, and demonstrate that deletion of the calcineurin docking domain results in the inability of Crz1 to translocate into the nucleus under thermal stress. RNA-sequencing revealed 102 genes that are regulated in a calcineurin-Crz1-dependent manner at 37°C. The majority of genes were down-regulated in cna1Δ and crz1Δ mutants, indicating these genes are normally activated by the calcineurin-Crz1 pathway at high temperature. About 58% of calcineurin-Crz1 target genes have unknown functions, while genes with known or predicted functions are involved in cell wall remodeling, calcium transport, and pheromone production. We identified three calcineurin-dependent response element motifs within the promoter regions of calcineurin-Crz1 target genes, and show that Crz1 binding to target gene promoters is increased upon thermal stress in a calcineurin-dependent fashion. Additionally, we found a large set of genes independently regulated by calcineurin, and Crz1 regulates 59 genes independently of calcineurin. Given the intermediate crz1Δ mutant phenotype, and our recent evidence for a calcineurin regulatory network impacting mRNA in P-bodies and stress granules independently of Crz1, calcineurin likely acts on factors beyond Crz1 that govern mRNA expression/stability to operate a branched transcriptional/post-transcriptional stress response network necessary for fungal virulence. Taken together, our findings reveal the core calcineurin-Crz1 stress response cascade is maintained from ascomycetes to a pathogenic basidiomycete fungus, but its output in C. neoformans appears to be adapted to promote fungal virulence.</em></small><br>[ID: 28376087]"

In order to determine the extent of biotrophic capacity in saprotrophic wood-decay fungi and which systems may be useful models, we investigated the colonization of conifer seedling roots in vitro using an array of 201 basidiomycete wood-decay fungi. Microtome sectioning, differential staining and fluorescence microscopy were used to visualize patterns of root colonization in microcosm systems containing Picea abies or Pinus sylvestris seedlings and each saprotrophic fungus. Thirty-four (16.9%) of the tested fungal species colonized the roots of at least one tree species. Two fungal species showed formation of a mantle and one showed Hartig net-like structures. These features suggest the possibility of an active functional symbiosis between fungus and plant.

Moya P, Molins A, Martínez-Alberola F, Muggia L, Barreno E<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The current literature reveals that the intrathalline coexistence of multiple microalgal taxa in lichens is more common than previously thought, and additional complexity is supported by the coexistence of bacteria and basidiomycete yeasts in lichen thalli. This replaces the old paradigm that lichen symbiosis occurs between a fungus and a single photobiont. The lichen Ramalina farinacea has proven to be a suitable model to study the multiplicity of microalgae in lichen thalli due to the constant coexistence of Trebouxia sp. TR9 and T. jamesii in long-distance populations. To date, studies involving phycobiont diversity within entire thalli are based on Sanger sequencing, but this method seems to underestimate the diversity. Here, we aim to analyze both the microalgal diversity and its community structure in a single thallus of the lichen R. farinacea by applying a 454 pyrosequencing approach coupled with a careful ad hoc-performed protocol for lichen sample processing prior to DNA extraction. To ascertain the reliability of the pyrosequencing results and the applied bioinformatics pipeline results, the thalli were divided into three sections (apical, middle and basal zones), and a mock community sample was used. The developed methodology allowed 40448 filtered algal reads to be obtained from a single lichen thallus, which encompassed 31 OTUs representative of different microalgae genera. In addition to corroborating the coexistence of the two Trebouxia sp. TR9 and T. jamesii taxa in the same thallus, this study showed a much higher microalgal diversity associated with the lichen. Along the thallus ramifications, we also detected variations in phycobiont distribution that might correlate with different microenvironmental conditions. These results highlight R. farinacea as a suitable material for studying microalgal diversity and further strengthen the concept of lichens as multispecies microecosystems. Future analyses will be relevant to ecophysiological and evolutionary studies to understand the roles of the multiple photobionts in lichen symbioses.</em></small><br>[ID: 28410402]"

Orihara T, Smith ME<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The sequestrate (truffle-like) basidiomycete Octaviania ivoryana was originally described based on collections from Zimbabwe, Kenya, Guinea, and Senegal. This species has basidiomes that stain blue-green and basidiospores with crowded spines that are characteristic of the genus Octaviania. However, O. ivoryana is the only Octaviania species described from sub-Saharan Africa, and the phylogenetic relationship of the species to other species of Octaviania sensu stricto has not been previously investigated. We examined the phylogenetic position of the isotype and paratype specimens of O. ivoryana based on two nuc rDNA loci-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]) and partial 28S-and the translation elongation factor 1-α gene. The resultant phylogenies indicate that O. ivoryana does not belong to Octaviania s. s. but instead forms a clade with the epigeous bolete genus, Porphyrellus sensu stricto (i.e., P. porphyrosporus and allies). The internal transcribed spacer phylogeny also recovers a monophyletic clade that includes sequences from O. ivoryana basidiomes as well as sequences from ectomycorrhizal root tips of Uapaca, Anthonotha, and assorted ectomycorrhizal Fabaceae species, suggesting that there is likely additional undescribed diversity within the lineage. We accordingly propose a new genus, Afrocastellanoa M.E. Sm. & Orihara, to accommodate the species O. ivoryana. Afrocastellanoa is morphologically distinct from Octaviania in the combination of a solid gleba, multilayered peridium, and the lack of distinct hymenium within the gleba. Our data suggest that the genus Afrocastellanoa is a unique sequestrate lineage with one described species and several undescribed species, all of which likely form ectomycorrhizas with African trees.</em></small><br>[ID: 28418780]"

Our results indicated that P. chrysosporium has a catabolic system that induces characteristic biomodifications of synthetic lignin through a series of redox reactions, leading not only to the degradation of lignin but also to its polymerization. The reducing agents ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol were used to stabilize the free radicals generated from the ligninolytic process. The application of P. chrysosporium in combination with reducing agents produced aromatic compounds and succinic acid as well as degraded lignin polymers. P. chrysosporium selectively catalyzed the conversion of lignin to succinic acid, which has an economic value. A transcriptomic analysis of P. chrysosporium suggested that the bond cleavage of synthetic lignin was caused by numerous enzymes, including extracellular enzymes such as lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase, and that the aromatic compounds released were metabolized in both the short-cut and classical tricarboxylic acid cycles of P. chrysosporium. In conclusion, P. chrysosporium is suitable as a biocatalyst for lignin degradation to produce a value-added product.</em></small><br>[ID: 28463479]"

Kabel MA, Jurak E, Mäkelä MR, de Vries RP<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The white button mushroom Agaricus bisporus is economically the most important commercially produced edible fungus. It is grown on carbon- and nitrogen-rich substrates, such as composted cereal straw and animal manure. The commercial mushroom production process is usually performed in buildings or tunnels under highly controlled environmental conditions. In nature, the basidiomycete A. bisporus has a significant impact on the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems as a saprotrophic decayer of leaf litter. In this mini-review, the fate of the compost plant cell wall structures, xylan, cellulose and lignin, is discussed. A comparison is made from the structural changes observed to the occurrence and function of enzymes for lignocellulose degradation present, with a special focus on the extracellular enzymes produced by A. bisporus. In addition, recent advancements in whole genome level molecular studies in various growth stages of A. bisporus in compost are reviewed.</em></small><br>[ID: 28466110]"

As a result, individual organisms are homoplasmic, containing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from a single parent. Here we analyzed the mitochondrial genotypes in Clade I of the gourmet mushroom Thelephora ganbajun from its broad geographic distribution range. A total of 299 isolates from 28 geographic locations were sequenced at three mitochondrial loci: the mitochondrial small ribosomal RNA gene, and the cytochrome c oxidase subunits I (COX1) and III (COX3) genes. Quantitative PCR analyses showed that the strains had about 60-160 copies of mitochondrial genomes per cell. Interestingly, while no evidence of heteroplasmy was found at the 12S rRNA gene, 262 of the 299 isolates had clear evidence of heterogeneity at either the COX1 (261 isolates) or COX3 (12 isolates) gene fragments. The COX1 heteroplasmy was characterized by two types of introns residing at different sites of the same region and at different frequencies among the isolates. Allelic association analyses of the observed mitochondrial polymorphic nucleotide sites suggest that mtDNA recombination is common in natural populations of this fungus. Our results contrast the prevailing view that heteroplasmy, if exists, is only transient in basidiomycete fungi.</em></small><br>[ID: 28487526]"

Wu J, Wang C, Zhu X, Chen J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>We have recently reported the identification of 10 double-strand RNA segments from Sclerotium hydrophilum [HZ11] mycelia and of virus-like particles isolated from the mycelia, as well as the sequences of dsRNA2 and dsRNA7. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that dsRNA2 and dsRNA7 belong to a group of unclassified viruses. In this report, we cloned and sequenced dsRNA6 and dsRNA9 from the 10 dsRNAs. We tentatively named the putative virus \"Sclerotium hydrophilum virus 1\", with isolates being abbreviated to ShV1, with dsRNA6 and dsRNA9 corresponding to dsRNA1 and dsRNA2, respectively, of ShV1. dsRNA1 was 1975 bp in length and encoded a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). dsRNA2 was 1728 bp and encoded a putative coat protein (CP). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the proteins encoded by dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 were highly related to known viral RdRps and CP, respectively, of viruses classified within the genus Alphapartitivirus of the family Partitiviridae. These members include Rhizoctonia solani dsRNA virus 2, Diuris pendunculata cryptic virus, and Heterobasidion partitivirus. The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the two dsRNAs showed a high sequence identity. The 5'-UTR contained conserved sequences 5'-GAAGCAUCACUU(/G) G(/U)AGU(/A)UCGC(/U)CCA(/G) CAAUAACGAA-3' and 5'-AAAUUGAUCUUACCUCUCAC-3'. The 3'-UTR contained the conserved sequence 5'-UUGUUUU-3' and 5'-UUUA(/U)A(/C) UUAU-3'. These results indicate that dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 are phylogenetically related to members of the genus Alphapartitivirus of family Partitiviridae. We therefore propose that dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 are the genome sequences of a new partitivirus, ShV1.</em></small><br>[ID: 28577215]"

By using Mfa2, a key player in the mating event in S. scitamineum as a tester gene, site-specific insertions of the introduced fragments were achieved both for Mfa2 knockout and complementation. Of particular advantage of this system is the simplicity of selection and identification for the desired transformants by using drug resistance coupled with PCR.

The dikaryotic O. rivulosa strain T241i (FBCC949) has been shown to selectively remove lignin from spruce wood prior to depolymerization of plant cell wall polysaccharides, thus possessing potential in biotechnological applications such as pretreatment of wood in pulp and paper industry. In this work, we studied the time-course of the conversion of spruce by the genome-sequenced monokaryotic O. rivulosa strain 3A-2, which is derived from the dikaryon T241i, to get insight into transcriptome level changes during prolonged solid state cultivation. During 8-week cultivation, O. rivulosa expressed a constitutive set of genes encoding putative plant cell wall degrading enzymes. High level of expression of the genes targeted towards all plant cell wall polymers was detected at 2-week time point, after which majority of the genes showed reduced expression. This implicated non-selective degradation of lignin by the O. rivulosa monokaryon and suggests high variation between mono- and dikaryotic strains of the white-rot fungi with respect to their abilities to convert plant cell wall polymers.</em></small><br>[ID: 28754284]"

Two of the viruses detected were new partitiviruses designated here as Heterobasidion partitivirus 16 (HetPV16) and HetPV20, and two were previously known partitiviruses: HetPV7 and HetPV13.

Raffaello T, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered to be one of the most destructive conifer pathogens in the temperate forests of the northern hemisphere. H. annosum is characterized by a dual fungal lifestyle. The fungus grows necrotrophically on living plant cells and saprotrophically on dead wood material. In this study, we screened the H. annosum genome for small secreted proteins (HaSSPs) that could potentially be involved in promoting necrotrophic growth during the fungal infection process. The final list included 58 HaSSPs that lacked predictable protein domains. The transient expression of HaSSP encoding genes revealed the ability of 8 HaSSPs to induce cell chlorosis and cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. In particular, one protein (HaSSP30) could induce a rapid, strong, and consistent cell death within 2 days post-infiltration. HaSSP30 also increased the transcription of host-defence-related genes in N. benthamiana, which suggested a necrotrophic-specific immune response. This is the first line of evidence demonstrating that the H. annosum genome encodes HaSSPs with the capability to induce plant cell death in a non-host plant.</em></small><br>[ID: 28801666]"

Nazareno ES, Li F, Smith M, Park RF, Kianian SF, Figueroa M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca) causes crown rust disease in cultivated and wild oat (Avena spp.). The significant yield losses inflicted by this pathogen make crown rust the most devastating disease in the oat industry. Pca is a basidiomycete fungus with an obligate biotrophic lifestyle, and is classified as a typical macrocyclic and heteroecious fungus. The asexual phase in the life cycle of Pca occurs in oat, whereas the sexual phase takes place primarily in Rhamnus species as the alternative host. Epidemics of crown rust happens in areas with warm temperatures (20-25 °C) and high humidity. Infection by the pathogen leads to plant lodging and shrivelled grain of poor quality. Disease symptoms: Infection of susceptible oat varieties gives rise to orange-yellow round to oblong uredinia (pustules) containing newly formed urediniospores. Pustules vary in size and can be larger than 5 mm in length. Infection occurs primarily on the surfaces of leaves, although occasional symptoms develop in the oat leaf sheaths and/or floral structures, such as awns. Symptoms in resistant oat varieties vary from flecks to small pustules, typically accompanied by chlorotic halos and/or necrosis. The pycnial and aecial stages are mostly present in the leaves of Rhamnus species, but occasionally symptoms can also be observed in petioles, young stems and floral structures. Aecial structures display a characteristic hypertrophy and can differ in size, occasionally reaching more than 5 mm in diameter. Taxonomy: Pca belongs to the kingdom Fungi, phylum Basidiomycota, class Pucciniomycetes, order Pucciniales and family Pucciniaceae. Host range: Puccinia coronata sensu lato can infect 290 species of grass hosts. Pca is prevalent in all oat-growing regions and, compared with other cereal rusts, displays a broad telial host range. The most common grass hosts of Pca include cultivated hexaploid oat (Avena sativa) and wild relatives, such as bluejoint grass, perennial ryegrass and fescue. Alternative hosts include several species of Rhamnus, with R. cathartica (common buckthorn) as the most important alternative host in Europe and North America.</em></small><br>[ID: 28846186]"

In protoplasting of D. squalens mycelia, Protoplast F outperformed two other cocktails while releasing similar amounts of protoplasts to a third cocktail. The protoplasts released using Protoplast F had a regeneration rate of 12.5% (±6 SE). Using Protoplast F, the D. squalens monokaryon CBS464.89 was conferred with resistance to the antibiotics hygromycin and G418 via polyethylene glycol mediated protoplast transformation with resistance cassettes expressing the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) and neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) genes, respectively. The hph gene was expressed in D. squalens using heterologous promoters from genes encoding β-tubulin or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. A Southern blot confirmed integration of a resistance cassette into the D. squalens genome. An average of six transformants (±2 SE) were obtained when at least several million protoplasts were used (a transformation efficiency of 0.8 (±0.3 SE) transformants per μg DNA). Transformation of D. squalens demonstrates the suitability of the Protoplast F cocktail for basidiomycete transformation and furthermore can facilitate understanding of basidiomycete gene function and development of improved strains for biotechnological applications.</em></small><br>[ID: 28987554]"

Feldman D, Kowbel DJ, Glass NL, Yarden O, Hadar Y<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Small secreted proteins (SSPs), along with lignocellulose degrading enzymes, are integral components of the secretome of Pleurotus ostreatus, a white rot fungus. In this study, we identified 3 genes (ssp1, 2 and 3) encoding proteins that are annotated as SSPs and that exhibited of ~4,500- fold expression, 24 hr following exposure to the toxic compound 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Homologues to genes encoding these SSPs are present in the genomes of other basidiomycete fungi, however the role of SSPs is not yet understood. SSPs, aryl-alcohol oxidases (AAO) and the intracellular aryl-alcohol dehydrogenases (AAD) were also produced after exposure to other aryl-alcohols, known substrates and inducers of AAOs, and during idiophase (after the onset of secondary metabolism). A knockdown strain of ssp1 exhibited reduced production of AAO-and AAD-encoding genes after HMF exposure. Conversely, a strain overexpressing ssp1 exhibited elevated expression of genes encoding AAOs and ADD, resulting in a 3-fold increase in enzymatic activity of AAOs, as well as increased expression and protein abundance of versatile peroxidase 1, which directly degrades lignin. We propose that in addition to symbionts and pathogens, SSPs also have roles in saprophytes and function in P. ostreatus as components of the ligninolytic system.</em></small><br>[ID: 29109463]"

Heterobasidion irregulare is a white-rot phytopathogenic fungus that causes wood decay in conifers. The genome of this fungus encodes 10 putative Auxiliary Activity family 9 (AA9) LPMOs. We describe the first biochemical characterization of H. irregulare LPMOs through heterologous expression of two CBM-containing LPMOs from this fungus (HiLPMO9H, HiLPMO9I) in Pichia pastoris. The oxidization preferences and substrate specificities of these two enzymes were determined. The two LPMOs were shown to cleave different carbohydrate components of plant cell walls. HiLPMO9H was active on cellulose and oxidized the substrate at the C1 carbon of the pyranose ring at β-1,4-glycosidic linkages, whereas HiLPMO9I cleaved cellulose with strict oxidization at the C4 carbon of glucose unit at internal bonds, and also showed activity against glucomannan. We propose that the two LPMOs play different roles in the plant-cell-wall degrading system of H. irregulare for degradation of softwood and that the lignocellulose degradation mediated by this white-rot fungus may require collective efforts from multi-types of LPMOs.</em></small><br>[ID: 29228039]"

Otero IVR, Ferro M, Bacci M Jr, Ferreira H, Sette LD<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Laccases are multicopper oxidases that are able to catalyze reactions involving a range of substrates, including phenols and amines, and this ability is related to the existence of different laccases. Basidiomycetes usually have more than one gene for laccase, but until now, this feature has not been demonstrated in a marine-derived fungus. Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063 is a basidiomycete fungus isolated from a marine sponge that exhibits the ability to secrete significant amounts of laccase in saline conditions. In the present study, we identified laccase sequences from the transcriptome of Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063 and used them to perform different molecular in silico analyses. The results revealed the presence of at least eight putative genes, which may encode ten different laccases with peptide lengths ranging from 482 to 588 aa and molecular weights ranging from 53.5 to 64.4 kDa. These laccases seem to perform extracellular activities, with the exception of one that may represent an intracellular laccase. The 10 predicted laccases expressed by Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063 in laccase-induced media showed different patterns of N-glycosylation and isoelectric points and are divided into two classes based on the residue associated with the regulation of the redox potential of the enzyme. None of the predicted laccases showed more than 61% similarity to other fungal laccases. Based on the differences among the laccases expressed by Peniophora sp. CBMAI 1063, this marine-derived basidiomycete represents a valuable resource with strong potential for biotechnological exploitation.</em></small><br>[ID: 29264716]"

In the presence of the rhizosphere bacterium Streptomyces AcH 505, enhanced colonization of Norway spruce roots with Heterobasidion abietinum 331 has previously been observed. By analyzing dual cultures of H. abietinum 331 and Streptomyces AcH 505 with HPLC, a fungal metabolite was identified that was increased in the presence of Streptomyces AcH 505. Likewise, challenge of H. abietum 331 with common antifungals produced by soil streptomycetes rendered the same effect. The structure of the compound, 5-formylsalicylic acid (5-FSA), was elucidated by HPLC-HR-ESI-Orbitrap-mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Based on in vivo measurements of maximum photosystem II efficiency of Norway spruce seedlings, 5-FSA did not influence plant vitality. However, when challenged with H. abietinum 331, ergosterol amounts in infected roots increased significantly for 5-FSA pre-treated seedlings. The severity of the infection was comparable to that observed in the presence of Streptomyces AcH 505. 5-FSA is a structural analogue of salicylic acid, an important signalling molecule active in plant defence. Thus, the expression of two defence-response related marker genes (PR1, Hel) was analysed in 5-FSA treated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings by Northern blot analysis. The transcription of both marker genes was altered, indicating that 5-FSA is perceived by Arabidopsis in a similar manner to salicylic acid and is able to interfere with Arabidopsis defence signalling. The role of 5-FSA as a potential virulence factor of H. abietinum 331 in the presence of Streptomyces AcH 505 is discussed.</em></small><br>[ID: 29350358]"

In this study, we used high throughput sequencing to analyze the endophytic microbial communities of different Quercus aquifolioides tissues with or without T. matsutake partner. About 35,000 clean reads were obtained per sample, representing 34 bacterial phyla and 7 fungal phyla. We observed 3980 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria and 457 OTUs of fungi at a 97% similarity level. Three bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, and the fungal phylum Ascomycota were dominant in all tissues. The relative abundance of these taxa differed significantly between Q. aquifolioides tissues with and without T. matsutake partner (p < 0.05). The bacterial genus Pseudomonas and the fungal genus Cryptosporiopsis were more abundant in mycorrhized roots than in control roots. This study showed that the community structure and dominant species of endophytic microbial communities in Q. aquifolioides tissues might be altered by colonization with T. matsutake.

The goal of the present work was to gain insights into the molecular biology and biochemistry of the heme-including class II and dye-decolorizing peroxidases secreted by this fungus. Proteomic analysis of the secretome of T. versicolor BRFM 1218 grown on oak wood revealed a set of 200 secreted proteins, among which were the dye-decolorizing peroxidase Tv DyP1 and the versatile peroxidase Tv VP2. Both peroxidases were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli , biochemically characterized, and tested for the ability to oxidize complex substrates. Both peroxidases were found to be active against several substrates under acidic conditions, and Tv DyP1 was very stable over a relatively large pH range of 2.0 to 6.0, while Tv VP2 was more stable at pH 5.0 to 6.0 only. The thermostability of both enzymes was also tested, and Tv DyP1 was globally found to be more stable than Tv VP2. After 180 min of incubation at temperatures ranging from 30 to 50°C, the activity of Tv VP2 drastically decreased, with 10 to 30% of the initial activity retained. Under the same conditions, Tv DyP1 retained 20 to 80% of its enzyme activity. The two proteins were catalytically characterized, and Tv VP2 was shown to accept a wider range of reducing substrates than Tv DyP1. Furthermore, both enzymes were found to be active against two flavonoids, quercetin and catechin, found in oak wood, with Tv VP2 displaying more rapid oxidation of the two compounds. They were tested for the ability to decolorize five industrial dyes, and Tv VP2 presented a greater ability to oxidize and decolorize the dye substrates than Tv DyP1. IMPORTANCE Trametes versicolor is a wood-inhabiting agaricomycete known for its ability to cause strong white-rot decay on hardwood and for its high tolerance of phenolic compounds. Among white-rot fungi, the basidiomycete T. versicolor has been extensively studied for its ability to degrade wood, specifically lignin, thanks to an extracellular oxidative enzymatic system. The corresponding oxidative system was previously studied in several works for classical lignin and manganese peroxidases, and in this study, two new components of the oxidative system of T. versicolor , one dye-decolorizing peroxidase and one versatile peroxidase, were biochemically characterized in depth and compared to other fungal peroxidases. </em></small><br>[ID: 29453263]"

The maximum yield of protoplasts (∼2.5 × 107/mL) was achieved when mycelium in the exponential growth phase (60 h) was used. The maximum stability was observed in MES+ buffer during 4 h of incubation; in this case the titer reduction was 5–7%. Studies of the effect of antioxidants with different antioxidant capacities expressed in mmol equivalents of Trolox (ascorbate, 0.99; α-tocopherol, 1.0; β-carotene, 2.14; quercetin, 3.98) indicated that the yield of protoplasts was increased in the presence of β-carotene and quercetin by 18–24%. The studied antioxidants did not affect the protoplasts stability. The degree of regeneration of protoplasts correlated with the antioxidant capacity of the studied antioxidants and was maximal (0.4%) in the presence of β-carotene and quercetin; it was 0.1% in the presence of MES+. The rate of protoplast growth was two times higher in the presence of β-carotene and quercetin.</em></small><br>[ID: 29509388]"

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been transformed in Kirk’s medium (under conditions of laccase production) with the formation of a quinone metabolite and 9-fluorenone upon the use of fluoranthene and fluorene as substrates, respectively. More complete degradation with the formation of an intermediate metabolite, phthalic acid that has undergone subsequent utilization, has occurred in basidiomycete-rich medium (under the production of both laccase and versatile peroxidase). The formation of phthalic acid as a metabolite of fluoranthene degradation by lignolytic fungi has been revealed for the first time. The data allow the supposition that both extracellular laccase and laccase on the mycelium surface can participate in the initial stages of PAH metabolism, while versatile peroxidase is necessary for the oxidation of the formed metabolites. A scheme of fluorene metabolism by Pleurotus ostreatus D1 is suggested.</em></small><br>[ID: 29513481]"

Tan X, Sun J, Ning H, Qin Z, Miao Y, Sun T, Zhang X<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Ganoderma lucidum is a valuable basidiomycete with numerous pharmacological compounds, which is widely consumed throughout China. We previously found that the polysaccharide content of Ganoderma lucidum fruiting bodies could be significantly improved by 45.63% with treatment of 42 °C heat stress (HS) for 2 h. To further investigate genes involved in HS response and explore the mechanisms of HS regulating the carbohydrate metabolism in Ganoderma lucidum, high-throughput RNA-Seq was conducted to analyse the difference between control and heat-treated mycelia at transcriptome level. We sequenced six cDNA libraries with three from control group (mycelia cultivated at 28 °C) and three from heat-treated group (mycelia subjected to 42 °C for 2 h). A total of 99,899 transcripts were generated using Trinity method and 59,136 unigenes were annotated by seven public databases. Among them, 2790 genes were identified to be differential expressed genes (DEGs) under HS condition, which included 1991 up-regulated and 799 down-regulated. 176 DEGs were then manually classified into five main responsive-related categories according to their putative functions and possible metabolic pathways. These groups include stress resistance-related factors; protein assembly, transportation and degradation; signal transduction; carbohydrate metabolism and energy provision-related process; other related functions, suggesting that a series of metabolic pathways in Ganoderma lucidum are activated by HS and the response mechanism involves a complex molecular network which needs further study. Remarkably, 48 DEGs were found to regulate carbohydrate metabolism, both in carbohydrate hydrolysis for energy provision and polysaccharide synthesis. In summary, this comprehensive transcriptome analysis will provide enlarged resource for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of basidiomycete under HS condition.</em></small><br>[ID: 29605602]"

Here, we report the biochemical, structural, and computational characterization of an LPMO from the white-rot fungus Heterobasidion irregulare (HiLPMO9B). This enzyme oxidizes cellulose at the C1 carbon of glycosidic linkages. The crystal structure of HiLPMO9B was determined at 2.1 Å resolution using X-ray crystallography. Unlike the majority of the currently available C1-specific LPMO structures, the HiLPMO9B structure contains an extended L2 loop, connecting β-strands β2 and β3 of the β-sandwich structure. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest roles for both aromatic and acidic residues in the substrate binding of HiLPMO9B, with the main contribution from the residues located on the extended region of the L2 loop (Tyr20) and the LC loop (Asp205, Tyr207, and Glu210). Asp205 and Glu210 were found to be involved in the hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group of the C6 carbon of glucose moieties directly or via a water molecule. Two different binding orientations were observed over the course of the MD simulations. In each orientation, the active-site copper of this LPMO preferentially skewed toward the pyranose C1 of the glycosidic linkage over the targeted glycosidic bond. This study provides additional insight into cellulose binding by C1-specific LPMOs, giving a molecular-level picture of active site substrate interactions.</em></small><br>[ID: 29660793]"

Diuron at a subtoxic concentration was added at the start of the cultivation in glucose liquid stationary cultures. Under this condition diuron was a laccase inducer. Almost 50% of the initially present diuron was removed after 15 d of cultivation. Two diuron metabolites were found N'-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methylurea (DCPMU) and 3,4-dichlorophenylurea (DCPU). The addition of the cytochrome P450 inhibitors 1-aminobenzotriazole and piperonyl butoxide reduced significantly the capability of the fungus in degrading diuron. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were significantly increased in the mycelial extracts by the presence of diuron. On the other hand, diuron did not cause any significant alteration in the levels of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, laccase could also degrade diuron in vitro and this degradation was increased by the addition of synthetic mediators, 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and acetylacetone. Significant reduction in the toxicity, as evaluated by the Lactuca sativa bioassay, was observed after G. lucidum treatment. In conclusion, G. lucidum is able to metabolize diuron by intra- and extracellular mechanisms, without the accumulation of toxic products.</em></small><br>[ID: 29801791]"

Eight second-generation single spore strains per fungal isolate pairing were investigated with specific genetic markers developed for both Finnish and Canadian parental isolates. Tests of linkage disequilibrium were used to analyze whether these markers assorted independently among single spore strains.

Finally, global non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to analyze independent random amplified microsatellite marker data to assess the genetic variability of the parental Finnish and Canadian isolates, and their second- and third-generation progeny. Our results revealed that the parental isolates from Finland and western Canada were genetically divergent, but no interfertility barriers were identified between these geographically distant fungi. Furthermore, parental genetic markers used in mating studies demonstrated that second- and third-generation spore progenies underwent normal meiosis and genetic recombination without linkage disequilibrium.

Hiscox J, O'Leary J, Boddy L<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Understanding the mechanisms underlying wood decay basidiomycete community dynamics is crucial for fully understanding decomposition processes, and for modelling ecosystem function and resilience to environmental change. Competition drives community development in decaying woody resources, with interactions occurring at a distance, following physical contact, and through specialised relationships such as mycoparasitism. Outcomes of combative interactions range from replacement, where one mycelium displaces another, to deadlock, where neither combatant captures territory from the other; and a spectrum of intermediate outcomes (i.e. partial or mutual replacement) lie between these extremes. Many wood decay basidiomycetes coexist within a resource, in a complex and dynamic community, and new research techniques are focussing on spatial orientation of interactions in 3 dimensions, as opposed to historical two-dimensional research. Not only do interactions drive changes in species composition and thus wood decomposition rate, they also may have industrial applications in biocontrol of pathogenic or nuisance fungi, enzyme production, and in the production of novel antifungals and antibiotics.

Structural modeling and comparison with other glucomannan-active LPMOs suggest that conserved sugar-interacting residues on the L2, L3 and LC loops may be essential for glucomannan binding, where 4 out of 7 residues are shared by HiLPMO9I, but only one is found in HiLPMO9B. The difference shown between these two H. irregulare LPMOs may reflect distinct biological roles of these enzymes within deconstruction of different plant cell wall polysaccharides during fungal colonization of softwood.</em></small><br>[ID: 30183773]"

Woraratanadharm T, Kmosek S, Banuett F<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The spatial organization of a cell is crucial for distribution of cell components and for cell morphogenesis in all organisms. Ustilago maydis, a basidiomycete fungus, has a yeast-like and a filamentous form. The former buds once per cell cycle at one of the cell poles, and can use the same site repeatedly or choose a new site at the same pole or opposite pole. The filamentous form consists of a long apical cell with short septate basal compartments lacking cytoplasm. It grows at the apex and can reverse growth forming a new growth zone at the basal end. We are interested in understanding how these different morphologies are generated. Here we present identification and characterization of U. maydis Tea1, a homologue of the fission yeast cell end marker Tea1. We demonstrate that UmTea1, a Kelch domain protein, interacts with itself and is an important determinant of the site of polarized growth: tea1 mutants bud simultaneously from both cell poles and form bifurcate buds. UmTea1 also regulates septum positioning, cell wall deposition, cell and neck width, coordination of nuclear division and cell separation, and localization of sterol-rich membrane domains. Some of these functions are shared with UmTea4, another cell end marker. We show that Tea1::GFP localizes to sites of polarized or potential polarized growth and to the septation site in the yeast-like form. Additionally, localization of Tea1::GFP as rings along the filament suggests that the filament undergoes septation. We hypothesize that Tea1 may act as a scaffold for the assembly of proteins that determine the site of polarized growth.</em></small><br>[ID: 30205200]"

Here we report on the high-quality genome sequence of T. horrida; it is composed of 23.2 Mb that encode 7,729 predicted genes and 6,973 genes supported by RNA-seq. The genome contains few repetitive elements that account for 8.45% of the total. Evolutionarily, T. horrida lies close to the Ustilago fungi, suggesting grass species as potential hosts, but co-linearity was not observed between T. horrida and the barley smut Ustilago hordei. Genes and functions relevant to pathogenicity were presumed. T. horrida possesses a smaller set of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secondary metabolites, which probably reflect the specific characteristics of its infection and biotrophic lifestyle. Genes that encode secreted proteins and enzymes of secondary metabolism, and genes that are represented in the pathogen-host interaction gene database genes, are highly expressed during early infection; this is consistent with their potential roles in pathogenicity. Furthermore, among the 131 candidate pathogen effectors identified according to their expression patterns and functionality, we validated two that trigger leaf cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana.

Arai T, Fukami D, Hoshino T, Kondo H, Tsuda S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Various microbes, including fungi and bacteria, that live in cold environments produce ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that protect them from freezing. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are two major phyla of fungi, and Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus is currently designated as the sole ascomycete that produces IBP (AnpIBP). However, its complete amino acid sequence, ice-binding property, and evolutionary history have not yet been clarified. Here, we determined the peptide sequences of three new AnpIBP isoforms by total cDNA analysis and compared them with those of other microbial IBPs. The AnpIBP isoforms and ascomycete-putative IBPs were found to be phylogenetically close to the bacterial ones but far from the basidiomycete ones, which is supported by the higher sequence identities to bacterial IBPs than basidiomycete IBPs, although ascomycetes are phylogenetically distant from bacteria. In addition, two of the isoforms of AnpIBP share low sequence identity and are not close in the phylogenetic tree. It is hence presumable that these two AnpIBP isoforms were independently acquired from different bacteria through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which implies that ascomycetes and bacteria frequently exchange their IBP genes. The non-colligative freezing-point depression ability of AnpIBP was not very high, whereas it exhibited significant abilities of ice recrystallization inhibition, ice shaping, and cryo-protection against freeze-thaw cycles even at submicromolar concentrations. These results suggest that HGT is crucial for the cold-adaptive evolution of ascomycetes, and their IBPs offer freeze resistance to organisms to enable them to inhabit the icy environments of Antarctica. DATABASES: Nucleotide sequence data are available in the DDBJ database under the accession numbers LC378707, LC378707, LC378707 for AnpIBP1a, AnpIBP1b, AnpIBP2, respectively.</em></small><br>[ID: 30548092]"

The model predicts that effective dominance-a measure that accounts for these two effects-should be close to 0.5 in these species. It also predicts that diploids should have higher fitness than haploids on average. However, an appropriate statistical framework to conjointly investigate these predictions is currently lacking.

Zeng Z, Wu J, Kovalchuk A, Raffaello T, Wen Z, Liu M, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Heterobasidion parviporum is the most devastating fungal pathogen of conifer forests in Northern Europe. The fungus has dual life strategies, necrotrophy on living trees and saprotrophy on dead woods. DNA cytosine methylation is an important epigenetic modification in eukaryotic organisms. Our presumption is that the lifestyle transition and asexual development in H. parviporum could be driven by epigenetic effects. Involvements of DNA methylation in the regulation of aforementioned processes have never been studied thus far. RNA-seq identified lists of highly induced genes enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes during necrotrophic interaction with host trees and saprotrophic sawdust growth. It also highlighted signaling- and transcription factor-related genes potentially associated with the transition of saprotrophic to necrotrophic lifestyle and groups of primary cellular activities throughout asexual development. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that DNA methylation displayed pronounced preference in CpG dinucleotide context across the genome and mostly targeted transposable element (TE)-rich regions. TE methylation level demonstrated a strong negative correlation with TE expression, reinforcing the protective function of DNA methylation in fungal genome stability. Small groups of genes putatively subject to methylation transcriptional regulation in response to saprotrophic and necrotrophic growth in comparison with free-living mycelia were also explored. Our study reported on the first methylome map of a forest pathogen. Analysis of transcriptome and methylome variations associated with asexual development and different lifestyle strategies provided further understanding of basic biological processes in H. parviporum.

Tuovinen V, Ekman S, Thor G, Vanderpool D, Spribille T, Johannesson H<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Since the late 1800s, mycologists have been detecting fungi above and beyond the assumed single fungus in lichen thalli [1-6]. Over the last century, these fungi have been accorded roles ranging from commensalists to pathogens. Recently, Cyphobasidiales yeasts were shown to be ubiquitous in the cortex layer of many macrolichens [7], but for most species, little is known of their cellular distribution and constancy beyond visible fruiting structures. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of an additional and distantly related basidiomycete, Tremella, in 95% of studied thalli in a global sample of one of the most intensively studied groups of lichens, the wolf lichens (genus Letharia). Tremella species are reported from a wide range of lichen genera [8], but until now, their biology was deduced from fruiting bodies (basidiomata) formed on lichen thalli. Based on this, they have been thought to be uncommon to rare, to occur exclusively in a hyphal form, and to be parasitic on the dominant fungal partner [9, 10]. We show that, in wolf lichens, Tremella occurs as yeast cells also in thalli that lack basidiomata and infer that this is its dominant stage in nature. We further show that the hyphal stage, when present in Letharia, is in close contact with algal cells, challenging the assumption that lichen-associated Tremella species are uniformly mycoparasites. Our results suggest that extent of occurrence and cellular interactions of known fungi within lichens have historically been underestimated and raise new questions about their function in specific lichen symbioses.</em></small><br>[ID: 30661799]"

U. maydis can be employed as a tool to explore physiological processes with more versatility than other fungi. Previously, U. maydis was only considered as a phytopathogenic fungus, but different studies have shown its potential as a research model. Therefore, numerous promising studies have focused on deepening our understanding of the natural interactions, enzyme production, and biotechnological capacity. In this review, we explore general characteristics of U. maydis, both as pathogenic and \"innocuous\" basidiomycete.

The highest catabolic activity of C. unicolor was observed after fungus precultivation on birch and ash sawdust media. The fungus growing in the dark showed the highest metabolic activity which was indicated by capacity to utilize a broad spectrum of compounds and the decomposition of 74/95 of the carbon sources. In all the culture light conditions, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was the most readily metabolized compound. The greatest tolerance to chemicals was also observed during C. unicolor growth in darkness. The fungus was the most sensitive to nitrogen compounds and antibiotics, but more resistant to chelators. Comparative analysis of C. unicolor and selected wood-decay fungi from different taxonomic and ecological groups revealed average catabolic activity of the fungus. However, C. unicolor showed outstanding capabilities to catabolize salicin and arbutin. The obtained picture of C. unicolor metabolism showed that the fungus abilities to decompose woody plant material are influenced by various environmental factors.</em></small><br>[ID: 30721259]"

Prieto-Recio C, Romeralo C, Bezos D, Martín-García J, Martínez-Álvarez P, Botella L, Diez JJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. (=Fomes annosus (Fr.) Cooke), one of the most important pathogens in coniferous forests in Europe, Asia, and North America, causes root and butt rot. H. annosum was first recorded on Pinus pinaster Ait. (commonly known as Maritime pine) in France and Great Britain in 1961 (4) and Portugal in 1986 (2). P. pinaster is the most widespread conifer in Spain, with more than 700,000 and 600,000 ha in pure and mixed stands, respectively. Over the last few years, P. pinaster decline was observed in several stands in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. Unusual crown transparency, small needles, foliage discoloration, and early tree death are characteristic decline symptoms associated with the high mortality rate on this species. In June of 2010, 11 trees (40 to 60 years old) with a different degree of decline were felled in two zones (42°2'41″N, 3°18'14″W, elevation 1,096 m and 41°55'40″N, 3°12'3″W, elevation 1,128 m) and cut into sections (stump height, breast height, and near the top). Wood slices were removed from each section and taken to the laboratory. Samples were placed in moist chambers with optimal conditions of humidity and temperature to enhance pathogen growth. After 20 days of incubation in darkness at 25°C, H. annosum (anamorph Spiniger meineckellum [A. Olson] Stalpers) occurred on most of these slices. Conidiophores with subglobose to pyriform conidia (5.8 × 4.2 μm) were observed with a compound microscope. The fungus was isolated to extract DNA by disruption of the mycelium followed by washes with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol solution (25:24:1). DNA was precipitated with 20% polyethylene glycol solution. PCR was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer of Dynazyme II DNA polymerase (Finnzymes Ltd, Espoo, Finland) with ITS primers, 1F (5'-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3') and 4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). After DNA purification, samples were sequenced (SECUGEN, Madrid, Spain) and aligned and corrected with Geneious Pro 5.3 to obtain the consensus sequences. Resulting DNA sequences of two isolates were deposited in GenBank (Nos. FR850494 and FR850495), and compared with a Blastn search at GenBank showing 100% identity and 100% coverage with H. annosum sensu stricto, former ISG-P (intersterility group of pines). For pathogenicity tests, 10 seedlings (2 year old) were inoculated with autoclaved P. pinaster wood chips colonized by H. annosum, and 10 control seedlings were inoculated with noncolonized wood chips. Inoculums were prepared by growing H. annosum on 4-mm-diameter wood chips placed on potato dextrose agar media for 3 weeks. The wood chips were put inside an oblique incision made at 6 cm above the soil line and wrapped with Parafilm. After 8 weeks in a growth chamber at 22.5°C with a 14-h photoperiod, the inoculated seedlings showed typical symptoms and 3 seedlings of 10 were dead. H. annosum was previously recorded on P. sylvestris in central Spain (1), causing needle drop, swelling at the stump height, and presence of dead trees by circular areas. This pathogen was also reported on P. nigra in northeastern Spain, associated with defoliation and mortality (3). To our knowledge, this is the first record of H. annosum on P. pinaster in Spain.

Matheron ME, Porchas M, Bigelow DM<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Brown heartwood rot, which often is found in branches within lemon groves in southwestern Arizona, is caused by two basidiomycete fungi, Antrodia sinuosa and Coniophora eremophila. Another fungus, a species of Nodulisporium, has been recovered from small, dying lemon tree branches with an internal white wood rot. Studies were conducted from 1999 through 2002 to compare the extent of wood decay caused by these fungi (i) on lemon tree branches at different times of the year, (ii) on different types of citrus, (iii) on some desert woody perennial plants, and (iv) on lemon tree branches treated with selected fungicides. The mean length of wood decay columns recorded in lemon tree branches inoculated with A. sinuosa, C. eremophila, and the Nodulisporium sp. during the time periods of November to January, February to April, May to July, and August to October was 2.9, 4.7, 13.3, and 15.2 cm, respectively. There was a significant linear correlation between the length of wood decay columns and air temperature for all three pathogens. The mean length of wood decay columns for all time periods in branches inoculated with A. sinuosa, C. eremophila, and the Nodulisporium sp. was 11.8, 5.8, and 9.6 cm, respectively. In two trials, wood decay columns were significantly greater on Lisbon lemon tree branches inoculated with A. sinuosa compared with those on Marsh grapefruit and Valencia orange trees inoculated with the same pathogen. Wood decay in the presence of the Nodulisporium sp. was greater on branches of lemon compared with grapefruit trees in two trials and on lemon compared with orange trees in one of two trials. With the exception of C. eremophila on creosote bush, each of the three wood rot pathogens caused some wood decay in branches of velvet mesquite, salt cedar, Mexican palo verde, and creosote bush, four common desert perennials found in southwestern Arizona. Compared with nontreated but inoculated lemon trees, the length of wood decay columns in branches inoculated with A. sinuosa, C. eremophila, and the Nodulisporium sp. in the presence of propiconazole was reduced by 79, 94, and 92%, respectively, and, in the presence of azoxystrobin, was suppressed by 71, 80, and 89%, respectively. Current management guidelines focus on minimizing branch fractures and other nonpruning wounds in conjunction with early detection and removal of infected branches before the onset of the increased wood decay development period extending from May to October.</em></small><br>[ID: 30781127]"

Choueiri E, Jreijiri F, Chlela P, Louvet G, Lecomte P<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Grapevine, cultivated mostly in the Bekaa Plain, is one of the most important fruit crops in Lebanon. During July 2004, a survey was made in 11 vineyards of local table or wine grapes to evaluate the sanitary status of the grapevine industry as far as wood declines are concerned. The most common grapevine decline was esca. The two forms of the disease (mild and severe) were observed. The mild form was characterized by leaf symptoms consisting of interveinal necrotic spots with yellow or red chlorotic blotches on white and red cultivars. The severe form was characterized by dieback of one or more shoots, leaf drop, shrivelling, and drying of fruit clusters. In west Bekaa, on cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, some vines showed symptoms identical to those of Eutypa dieback such as stunted chlorotic shoots with small, distorted leaves; moreover, symptoms corresponding to black dead arm (BDA) such as wine red spots on the margins of leaves and dry spots were seen as reported earlier (1). Diseased vines of various cultivars were collected: 10 Cabernet Sauvignon (7 esca, 3 BDA, and 1 Eutypa dieback), 4 Beitamouni, 3 Carignan, 2 Teifihi, 1 Zeitouni, 1 Mourverdre, 1 Caladoc, and 1 Merlot. In wood, cross sections through the trunk were made that showed mainly central necrosis, white heart rot, brown red wood, and black spotting. Wedge-shaped lesions were the least common. Particularly for BDA, peeling off the bark revealed a brown streaking of the external wood. Isolations were made on malt agar (MA) with wood chips cut from the different necroses described above. Fungal identifications were based on morphological characteristics in comparison with French isolates after subculturing at 20 to 22°C: Fomitiporia sp. (F85-1), Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (F85-2), Eutypa lata (BX1-10, 8D, and 8F), and Botryosphaeria obtusa (F99-1). The fungus most frequently isolated from central necrosis with white heart rot was the basidiomycete Fomitiporia sp. (35% of vines). Cultures of Fomitiporia sp. on MA reached 4 to 5 cm in diameter after 2 weeks and were yellowish to brownish without conidia. P. chlamydospora (associated with esca, black goo, or Petri disease) was isolated from only 9% of vines investigated. Cultures of P. chlamydospora on MA were slow growing and reached 7 to 8 mm in diameter in the dark after 8 days. Colonies were white but became light green and later became dark green. Sporulation was abundant. E. lata (causing Eutypa dieback) was isolated from the vine of cv. Cabernet Sauvignon showing typical symptoms and from two vines showing symptoms of esca only. Two strains produced characteristic pycniospores, and all strains were identified using polymerase chain reaction (Primer Scar 10A-10B) (2). Among the saprophytic fungi isolated from the different kinds of necroses, either central, wedge-shaped, or under the bark, B. obtusa associated with BDA was found most commonly (65% of vines). Cultures of B. obtusa were gray brown with dense aerial mycelium. Pycnidia started to form after 4 to 5 days and conidia (20 to 26 × 9 to 16 μm) were dark brown when mature. These results are consistent with previous descriptions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of black dead arm in Lebanon. References: (1) P. Larignon et al. Phytopathol.

Dai YC, Korhonen K<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Members of the Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. complex are among the most important pathogens in coniferous forests of Europe and North America. Three intersterile groups (P, S, and F) have been found in this complex from Europe (1) and were recently segregated into three species based on intersterility, host preferences, and morphology (4). In a survey of wood-rotting fungi in China in 2002, Heterobasidion spp. were found on Tsuga chinensis (Franch.) Pritz and T. dumosa (D. Don) Eichl. in natural forests from the northern Sichuan Province of southwestern China (32°43' to 33°11' N, 103°50' to 103°53' E.). Basidiocarps of the fungus were relatively common on decayed wood in roots of dead trees, stumps, and fallen trunks. We collected four basidiocarps (Dai 4045, 4051, 4214, and 4224 in the Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, IFP) from three stands of mixed coniferous forests and made 40 homokaryotic, single-basidiospore cultures (02046, 02047, 02050, and 02051 in the Finnish Forest Research Institute). Two homokaryons from each basidiocarp were paired with homokaryotic tester strains of European H. annosum (P group), H. parviporum Niemelä & Korhonen (S group), and H. abietinum Niemelä & Korhonen (F group). The pairings showed that the progeny from the four basidiocarps are H. parviporum. The Chinese isolates did not form clamp connections with H. annosum sensu stricto, and a strong demarcation line developed in all these pairings. In contrast, the Chinese isolates formed clamp connections in almost every pairing with European H. parviporum, the clamp connections developed in both sides of the pairings, and no distinct demarcation line was present in most of these pairings. The Chinese homokaryons were also compatible with European H. abietinum, but in most of these pairings, clamp connections were found in the isolate from China but not in the European tester, and a demarcation line was present in most of the pairings. In contrast to H. annosum sensu stricto, the Chinese basidiocarps had smaller pores (4.5 to 6 per mm versus 3 to 4.5 per mm), and a thin tomentum on the pileal surface in contrast to the basidiocarps of H. abietinum. Previously, H. parviporum was found in Asia on coniferous hosts such as Abies, Larix, Picea and Pinus spp. (2). The North American S group of H. annosum sensu lato attacks species of Tsuga spp. in western North America (3), but to our knowledge, this is the first report of H. parviporum on native species of Tsuga spp. outside North America.

Burpee LL, Mims CW, Tredway LP, Bae J, Jung G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>An unusual and undescribed foliar blight of tall fescue was observed in a home lawn and in turf grass research plots near Griffin, GA in May and June, 2000 and 2001. Isolation from lesions yielded mycelium of a basidiomycete with hyphal characteristics (binucleate cells, absence of clamp connections) associated with Laetisaria and Limonomyces spp. Isolates from blighted tall fescue and an isolate of Limonomyces roseipellis formed a clade distinct from isolates of Laetisaria fuciformis based on ribosomal DNA sequences. These data, in conjunction with cultural morphology, indicate that the basidiomycete from tall fescue represents a biotype of Limonomyces roseipellis that lacks clamp connections. In a controlled environment, isolates of the biotype induced foliar blight in the fescue cvs. Kentucky 31 and Rebel III. Histological observations revealed that the fungus colonized leaf surfaces as branched hyphae and aggregated hyphal strands. Penetration occurred via stomatal pores on the abaxial leaf surface. Colonization of leaf tissues was inter- and intracellular, with no evidence of papilla formation in response to invading hyphae. The name \"cream leaf blight\" is proposed for this new disease of tall fescue.</em></small><br>[ID: 30812814]"

Reina R, Kellner H, Hess J, Jehmlich N, García-Romera I, Aranda E, Hofrichter M, Liers C<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Chondrostereum purpureum (Silverleaf fungus) is a saprotroph and plant pathogen commercially used for combatting forest \"weed\" trees in vegetation management. However, little is known about its lignocellulose-degrading capabilities and the enzymatic machinery that is responsible for the degradative potential, and it is not yet clear to which group of wood-rot fungi it actually belongs. Here, we sequenced and analyzed the draft genome of C. purpureum (41.2 Mbp) and performed a quantitative proteomic approach during growth in submerged and solid-state cultures based on soybean meal suspension or containing beech wood supplemented with phenol-rich olive mill residues, respectively. The fungus harbors characteristic lignocellulolytic hydrolases (GH6 and GH7) and oxidoreductases (e.g. laccase, heme peroxidases). High abundance of some of these genes (e.g. 45 laccases, nine GH7) can be explained by gene expansion, e.g. identified for the laccase orthogroup ORTHOMCL11 that exhibits a total of 18 lineage-specific duplications. Other expanded genes families encode for proteins more related to a pathogenic lifestyle (e.g. protease and cytochrome P450s). The fungus responds to the presence of complex growth substrates (lignocellulose, phenolic residues) by the secretion of most of these lignocellulolytic and lignin-modifying enzymes (e.g. alcohol and aryl alcohol oxidases, laccases, GH6, GH7). Based on the genetic and enzymatic constitution, we consider the 'marasmioid' fungus C. purpureum as a 'phytopathogenic' white-rot fungus (WRF) that possesses a complex extracellular enzyme machinery to accomplish efficient lignocellulose degradation during both saprotrophic and phytopathogenic life phases.</em></small><br>[ID: 30822315]"

Garbelotto M, Chapela I<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.:Fr.) Bref. is a pathogen of conifers in the Northern Hemisphere. This fungus has been previously reported from Pinus spp. (1) and from Abies religiosa (H.B.K.) Schl. et Cham. (2) in Central Mexico. In 1998, H. annosum was collected for the first time from stumps of Abies hickeli Flous et Gaussen in the Southern Mexican State of Oaxaca, at an altitude of 2,900 m (Lat 17° 28' N, Long 96° 31' W). Although standing trees at the sampled site were asymptomatic, the sapwood and heartwood of several fir stumps were extensively decayed. The white laminated rot was similar to that caused by H. annosum on other Abies spp. Decay pockets extended to the upper surface of the stumps, indicating the fungus had infected and colonized the tree butts prior to tree felling. H. annosum basidiocarps were found both outside the roots in the duff layer and inside the decay pockets. The anamorph of H. annosum (Spiniger meineckellum (A. Olson) Stalpers) was isolated from the context of three basidiocarps. Based on comparative analysis of DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region, all three isolates belonged to the North American S intersterility group (ISG). This report expands the host and the geographic ranges of the North American S ISG, and represents the world's southernmost finding of an Abies species infected by this pathogen. References: (1) R.

In higher termites, the mutualistic association between the basidiomycete genus Termitomyces and Macrotermitinae is well known. However, whether and how lower termites use fungi is unclear. Here, we found a large amount of brown sclerotium-forming fungi in egg piles of the lower termite Reticulitermes labralis and identified the sclerotia as Fibulorhizoctonia sp. There was a significant difference in morphology between the sclerotia and the termite eggs. The workers of R. labralis and R. chinensis actively gathered the sclerotia into the egg piles within their nests, whereas the workers of R. aculabialis did not gather sclerotia outside their nests. None of the sclerotia in the egg piles germinated in the presence of workers. However, the sclerotia germinated in the absence of workers, and then the hyphae killed the termite eggs. The data from cellulase activity demonstrated that Fibulorhizoctonia sp. was able to exhaustively digest cellulose into glucose.We confirmed for the first time that the workers carrying the sclerotia into the piles of eggs is not due to mistaking the sclerotia for their eggs and that the workers of R. labralis may be able to select favourite fungi.</em></small><br>[ID: 30833643]"

Cardwell KF<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>A leaf disease of maize previously described as borde blanco (1) or horizontal banded blight (2) was recently observed for the first time in three West African countries. The symptom was white, dry lesions that grew phasically on the edge of the leaf, resulting in horizontal bands delineated by purple to brown margins. Minute basidiocarps (1 mm high) were seen in the white zone of the banded lesions, often arranged linearly. The appearance of the fungus was consistent with a report from Sierra Leone and Guinea Conakry of a basidiomycete on maize of the order Agaricales, Marasmiellus paspalli (Petch) Singer (2). Lamellae were lacking, replaced on mature basidiomes by up to four ridges, which concurred with the description of an unnamed West African variety (1). The pileus and stipe of the mushroom were consistently white when fresh, and light beige when mature. The fungus grew readily on potato dextrose agar, forming a cottony white colony with occasional dark stromatic tissue, and hyphae with abundant clamp connections. Out of over 100 fields visited in 1993 and 1994, the disease was seen in one site only in southern Cameroon in 1994. In 1997, it was found in all maize fields in four separate areas in the southern humid forest zone of that country. In Ghana in November 1996, it was prevalent in a survey of 60 fields, with leaf area losses from 30 to 40%. In August of 1997, the disease appeared in low incidence on maize in Nigeria. The appearance of the Marasmiellus disease in Cameroon, Nigeria, and Ghana in the last 3 years represents a geographic shift from where the pathogen has been previously reported (1,2). It is not known at this time if significant yield loss is being incurred. References: (1) F. M. Latterell and A. E. Rossi. Plant Dis. 68:728, 1984. (2) M. M. Payak and R. C. Sharma. Curr.

With whole-genome sequencing and variant discovery, we also found that mutation had occurred within the somatic cells of the individual, reflecting its historical pattern of growth from a single point. The overall rate of mutation over the 90 mb genome, however, was extremely low. This same individual was first discovered in the late 1980s, but its full spatial extent and internal mutation dynamic was unknown at that time. The large individual of A. gallica has been remarkably resistant to genomic change as it has persisted in place.</em></small><br>[ID: 30963893]"

Takano T, Yamamoto N, Suzuki T, Dohra H, Choi JH, Terashima Y, Yokoyama K, Kawagishi H, Yano K<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Circular patterns called \"fairy rings\" in fields are a natural phenomenon that arises through the interaction between basidiomycete fungi and plants. Acceleration or inhibition of plant vegetative growth and the formation of mushroom fruiting bodies are both commonly observed when fairy rings form. The gene of an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of these regulators was recently isolated in the fairy ring-forming fungus, Lepista sordida. To identify other genes involved in L. sordida fairy ring formation, we used previously generated sequence data to produce a more complete draft genome sequence for this species. Finally, we predicted the metabolic pathways of the plant growth regulators and 29 candidate enzyme-coding genes involved in fairy-ring formation based on gene annotations. Comparisons of protein coding genes among basidiomycete fungi revealed two nitric oxide synthase gene candidates that were uniquely encoded in genomes of fairy ring-forming fungi. These results provide a basis for the discovery of genes involved in fairy ring formation and for understanding the mechanisms involved in the interaction between fungi and plants. We also constructed a new web database F-RINGS ( http://bioinf.mind.meiji.ac.jp/f-rings/ ) to provide the comprehensive genomic information for L. sordida.</em></small><br>[ID: 30971747]"

Cui W, Li X, Hull L, Xiao M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycete fungus that is highly resistant to ionizing radiation and has been identified in highly radioactive environments. Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences within promoters of target genes. A library of 322 signature-tagged gene deletion strains for 155 C. neoformans TF genes has been established. Previous phenome-based functional analysis of the C. neoformans TF mutant library identified key TFs important for various phenotypes, such as growth, differentiation, virulence-factor production, and stress responses. Here, utilizing the established TF mutant library, we identified 5 TFs that are important for radiation sensitivity, including SRE1, BZP2, GAT5, GAT6, and HCM1. Interestingly, BZP2, GAT5 and GAT6 all belong to the GATA-type transcription factors. These factors regulate transcription of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) sensitive genes when preferred nitrogen sources are absent or limiting. In addition to radiation, we found that specific GATA factors are important for other stressors such as rapamycin, fluconazole, and hydroxyurea treatment. Using real-time PCR method, we studied the expression of GATA down-stream genes after radiation exposure and identified that AAP4, AAP5 and URO1 were differentially expressed in the GAT5 and GAT6 mutants compared to the wild type cells. In summary, our data suggest that GATA TFs are important for radiation sensitivity in C. neoformans by regulating specific downstream AAP genes.</em></small><br>[ID: 31015536]"

Shen XT, Mo XH, Zhu LP, Tan LL, Du FY, Wang QW, Zhou YM, Yuan XJ, Qiao B, Yang S<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em> Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans , human-pathogenic fungi found worldwide, are receiving increasing attention due to high morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In the present work, 110 fungus pairs were constructed by coculturing 16 wood-decaying basidiomycetes, among which coculture of Trametes robiniophila Murr and Pleurotus ostreatus was found to strongly inhibit pathogenic fungi through bioactivity-guided assays. A combination of metabolomics and molecular network analysis revealed that 44 features were either newly synthesized or produced at high levels in this coculture system and that 6 of the features that belonged to a family of novel and unusual linear sesterterpenes contributed to high activity with MICs of 1 to 32 μg/ml against pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, dynamic 13 C-labeling analysis revealed an association between induced features and the corresponding fungi. Unusual sesterterpenes were 13 C labeled only in P. ostreatus in a time course after stimulation by the coculture, suggesting that these sesterterpenes were synthesized by P. ostreatus instead of T. robiniophila Murr. Sesterterpene compounds 1 to 3 were renamed postrediene A to C. Real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis revealed that transcriptional levels of three genes encoding terpene synthase, farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase, and oxidase were found to be 8.2-fold, 88.7-fold, and 21.6-fold higher, respectively, in the coculture than in the monoculture, indicating that biosynthetic gene cluster 10 was most likely responsible for the synthesis of these sesterterpenes. A putative biosynthetic pathway of postrediene A to postrediene C was then proposed based on structures of sesterterpenes and molecular network analysis. IMPORTANCE A number of gene clusters involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites are presumably silent or expressed at low levels under conditions of standard laboratory cultivation, resulting in a large gap between the pool of discovered metabolites and genome capability. This work mimicked naturally occurring competition by construction of an artificial coculture of basidiomycete fungi for the identification of secondary metabolites with novel scaffolds and excellent bioactivity. Unusual linear sesterterpenes of postrediene A to C synthesized by P. ostreatus not only were promising lead drugs against human-pathogenic fungi but also highlighted a distinct pathway for sesterterpene biosynthesis in basidiomycetes. The current work provides an important basis for uncovering novel gene functions involved in sesterterpene synthesis and for gaining insights into the mechanism of silent gene activation in fungal defense. </em></small><br>[ID: 31053589]"

Nieuwenhuis M, van de Peppel LJJ, Bakker FT, Zwaan BJ, Aanen DK<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Mitochondria retain their own genome, a hallmark of their bacterial ancestry. Mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) are highly diverse in size, shape, and structure, despite their conserved function across most eukaryotes. Exploring extreme cases of mtDNA architecture can yield important information on fundamental aspects of genome biology. We discovered that the mitochondrial genomes of a basidiomycete fungus (Termitomyces spp.) contain an inverted repeat (IR), a duplicated region half the size of the complete genome. In addition, we found an abundance of sequences capable of forming G-quadruplexes (G4DNA); structures that can disrupt the double helical formation of DNA. G4DNA is implicated in replication fork stalling, double-stranded breaks, altered gene expression, recombination, and other effects. To determine whether this occurrence of IR and G4DNA was correlated within the genus Termitomyces, we reconstructed the mitochondrial genomes of 11 additional species including representatives of several closely related genera. We show that the mtDNA of all sampled species of Termitomyces and its sister group, represented by the species Tephrocybe rancida and Blastosporella zonata, are characterized by a large IR and enrichment of G4DNA. To determine whether high mitochondrial G4DNA content is common in fungi, we conducted the first broad survey of G4DNA content in fungal mtDNA, revealing it to be a highly variable trait. The results of this study provide important direction for future research on the function and evolution of G4DNA and organellar IRs.</em></small><br>[ID: 31209489]"

Karrer D, Rühl M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Oxylipins are metabolites with a variety of biological functions. However, the biosynthetic pathway is widely unknown. It is considered that the first step is the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids like linoleic acid. Therefore, a lipoxygenase (LOX) from the edible basidiomycete Agrocybe aegerita was investigated. The AaeLOX4 was heterologously expressed in E. coli and purified via affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Biochemical properties and kinetic parameters of the purified AaeLOX4 were determined with linoleic acid and linolenic acid as substrates. The obtained Km, vmax and kcat values for linoleic acid were 295.5 μM, 16.5 μM · min-1 · mg-1 and 103.9 s-1, respectively. For linolenic acid Km, vmax and kcat values of 634.2 μM, 19.5 μM · min-1 · mg-1 and 18.3 s-1 were calculated. Maximum activities were observed at pH 7.5 and 25 °C. The main product of linoleic acid conversion was identified with normal-phase HPLC. This analysis revealed an explicit production of 13-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPOD). The experimental regio specificity is underpinned by the amino acid residues W384, F450, R594 and V635 considered relevant for regio specificity in LOX.

Three series of X-ray diffraction data sets were collected with increasing doses of absorbed X-ray radiation from a native S. murashkinskyi laccase crystal and from crystals of complexes of the laccase with chloride and fluoride ions. The data for the native laccase crystal confirmed the previously deduced enzymatic mechanism of molecular oxygen reduction. The structures of the complexes allowed the localization of chloride and fluoride ions in the channel near the T2 copper ion. These ions replace the oxygen ligand of the T2 copper ion in this channel and can play the role of this ligand in the enzymatic reaction. As follows from analysis of the structures from the increasing dose series, the inhibition of laccases by chloride and fluoride anions can be explained by the fact that the binding of these negatively charged ions at the position of the oxygen ligand of the T2 copper ion impedes the reduction of the T2 copper ion.</em></small><br>[ID: 31478903]"

Mukrimin M, Kovalchuk A, Ghimire RP, Kivimäenpää M, Sun H, Holopainen JK, Asiegbu FO<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Two terpene compounds and four genes were identified as potential biomarkers for further evaluation for Scots pine susceptibility or tolerance against Heterobasidion annosum. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is one of the main sources of timber in the boreal zone of Eurasia. Commercial pine plantations are vulnerable to root and butt rot disease caused by the fungus Heterobasidion annosum. The pathogen affects host growth rate, causes higher mortality and decreases in timber quality, resulting in considerable economic losses to forest owners. Genetic and biochemical factors contributing to Scots pine tolerance against H. annosum infection are not well understood. We assessed the predictive values of a set of potential genetic and chemical markers in a field experiment. We determined the expression levels of 25 genes and the concentrations of 36 terpenoid compounds in needles of 16 Scots pine trees randomly selected from a natural population prior to artificial infection. Stems of the same trees were artificially inoculated with H. annosum, and the length of necrotic lesions was documented 5 months post inoculation. Higher expression level of four genes included in our analysis and encoding predicted α-pinene synthase (two genes), geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS), and metacaspase 5 (MC5), could be associated with trees exhibiting increased levels of necrotic lesion formation in response to fungal inoculation. In contrast, concentrations of two terpenoid compounds, β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, showed significant negative correlations with the lesion size. Further studies with larger sample size will help to elucidate new biomarkers or clarify the potential of the evaluated markers for use in Scots pine disease resistance breeding programs.</em></small><br>[ID: 31485774]"

Ling JG, Mansor MH, Abdul Murad AM, Mohd Khalid R, Quay DHX, Winkler M, Abu Bakar FD<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) are attracting burgeoning attention as biocatalysts for organic synthesis of aldehydes and their follow-up products from economic carboxylic acid precursors. The CAR enzyme class as a whole, however, is still poorly understood. To date, relatively few CAR sequences have been reported, especially from fungal sources. Here, we sought to increase the diversity of the CAR enzyme class. Six new CAR sequences from the white-rot fungus Pycnoporus cinnabarinus were identified from genome-wide mining. Genome and gene clustering analysis suggests that these PcCAR enzymes play different natural roles in Basidiomycete systems, compared to their type II Ascomycete counterparts. The cDNA sequences of all six Pccar genes were deduced and analysis of their corresponding amino acid sequence showed that they encode for proteins of similar properties that possess a conserved modular functional tri-domain arrangement. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all PcCAR enzymes cluster together with the other type IV CARs. One candidate, PcCAR4, was cloned and over-expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli. Subsequent biotransformation-based screening with a panel of structurally-diverse carboxylic acid substrates suggest that PcCAR4 possessed a more pronounced substrate specificity compared to previously reported CARs, preferring to reduce sterically-rigid carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid. These findings thus present a new functionally-distinct member of the CAR enzyme class.</em></small><br>[ID: 31545972]"

Schizophyllum commune (S commune) is a common basidiomycete fungus that is rarely involved in human disease. We report herein a case of S commune sinusitis after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. A 66-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and developed maxillary and ethmoid sinusitis. The sinusitis did not improve with liposomal amphotericin B after neutrophil engraftment, so we considered that surgical intervention was needed for the recovery of sinusitis. Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed. In the debridement tissue of paranasal mucosa, filamentous fungal elements were observed. Moreover, genetic analysis of the tissue revealed the presence of S commune. Schizophyllum commune should be recognized as a fungal pathogen that causes sinusitis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This case suggests the effectiveness of prompt surgical intervention with liposomal amphotericin B treatment for S commune sinusitis and the usefulness of genetic diagnosis for cases under antifungal treatment.

Moiseenko KV, Glazunova OA, Shakhova NV, Savinova OS, Vasina DV, Tyazhelova TV, Psurtseva NV, Fedorova TV<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em> Steccherinum ochraceum is a white rot basidiomycete with wide ecological amplitude. It occurs in different regions of Russia and throughout the world, occupying different climatic zones. S. ochraceum colonizes stumps, trunks, and branches of various deciduous (seldom coniferous) trees. As a secondary colonizing fungus, S. ochraceum is mainly observed at the late decay stages. Here, we present the de novo assembly and annotation of the genome of S. ochraceum , LE-BIN 3174. This is the 8th published genome of fungus from the residual polyporoid clade and the first from the Steccherinaceae family. The obtained genome provides a first glimpse into the genetic and enzymatic mechanisms governing adaptation of S. ochraceum to an ecological niche of pre-degraded wood. It is proposed that increased number of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) belonging to the AA superfamily and decreased number of CAZymes belonging to the GH superfamily reflects substrate preferences of S. ochraceum . This proposition is further substantiated by the results of the biochemical plate tests and exoproteomic study, which demonstrates that S. ochraceum assumes the intermediate position between typical primary colonizing fungi and litter decomposers or humus saprotrophs. Phylogenetic analysis of S. ochraceum laccase and class II peroxidase genes revealed the distinct evolutional origin of these genes in the Steccherinaceae family. </em></small><br>[ID: 31694151]"

Pawlik A, Jaszek M, Sulej J, Janusz G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The light-dependent metabolism of the white rot basidiomycete Cerrena unicolor FCL139 has already been demonstrated using transcriptomic and Biolog-based approaches. To further analyze the influence of light on C. unicolor wood degradation, we measured the activity of an array of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes) and enzymes involved in the redox system of fungal cells associated with lignolysis. Extra- and intracellular enzymatic extracts were obtained from solid-state ash sawdust C. unicolor cultures cultivated for 14 days under red, blue, green, or white light conditions, or in the dark. Light greatly influenced the synthesis of MnP, total cellulases, endo-1,4-β-glucanase, endo-1,4-β-xylanase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. The production of MnP and catalase was evidently stimulated by white light. It is also worth noticing that blue light caused a gradual increase in the activity of total cellulases throughout the entire period of C. unicolor growth. Moreover, endo-1,4-β-glucanase showed the highest activity on day 13 of fungus cultivation and the production of laccase and β-glucosidase appeared to be the least influenced by light. However, the strongest activity of the endo-1,4-β-xylanase was observed in the dark. It seemed that light not only influenced the regulation of the synthesis of the wood-degrading enzymes at different levels, but also acted indirectly by affecting production of enzymes managing harmful lignin by-products causing oxidative stress. The ability of the fungus to decompose woody plant material is clearly influenced by environmental factors.</em></small><br>[ID: 31697461]"

Bakkeren G, Szabo LJ<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Among the thousands of rust species described, many are known for their devastating effects on their hosts, which include major agriculture crops and trees. Hence, for over a century, these basidiomycete pathogenic fungi have been researched and experimented with. However, due to their biotrophic nature, they are challenging organisms to work with and, needing their hosts for propagation, represent pathosystems that are not easily experimentally accessible. Indeed, efforts to perform genetics have been few and far apart for the rust fungi, though one study performed in the 1940s was famously instrumental in formulating the gene-for-gene hypothesis describing pathogen-host interactions. By taking full advantage of the molecular genetic tools developed in the 1980s, research on many plant pathogenic microbes thrived, yet similar work on the rusts remained very challenging though not without some successes. However, the genomics era brought real breakthrough research for the biotrophic fungi and with innovative experimentation and the use of heterologous systems, molecular genetic analyses over the last 2 decades have significantly advanced our insight into the function of many rust fungus genes and their role in the interaction with their hosts. This has allowed optimizing efforts for resistance breeding and the design and testing of various novel strategies to reduce the devastating diseases they cause.</em></small><br>[ID: 31799902]"

However, whether medina also facilitates treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third global cause of cancer deaths, remains unknown. Here, we examined its potential as a radiosensitizer in HCC radiotherapy using human HCC Hep3B and HepG2 cell lines and xenograft tumors. Mesima pretreatment significantly enhanced HCC cell radiosensitivity in vitro and the combination of mesima + radiation treatment significantly reduced xenograft tumor growth and size in vivo compared to those with single treatments. Mechanistically, mesima significantly enhanced radiotherapy efficiency by inhibiting tumor cell survival through inducing apoptosis (assessed via annexin V), impairing cell cycle regulation (shown by flow cytometry), and reducing radiation-induced DNA damage repair (measured via γ-H2AX foci). Combination treatment also facilitated autophagic cell death beyond that from single treatments (assessed by quantifying stained acidic vesicular organelles), and diminished tumor cell metastatic potentials (shown by wound and Transwell assays). These findings support the synergistic anti-tumor effects of mesima combined with radiation and suggest scientific evidence for mesima as a radiosensitizer in HCC.</em></small><br>[ID: 32013255]"

Kemppainen M, Chowdhury J, Lundberg-Felten J, Pardo A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>For long time, studies on ectomycorrhiza (ECM) have been limited by inefficient expression of fluorescent proteins (FPs) in the fungal partner. To convert this situation, we have evaluated the basic requirements of FP expression in the model ECM homobasidiomycete Laccaria bicolor and established eGFP and mCherry as functional FP markers. Comparison of intron-containing and intronless FP-expression cassettes confirmed that intron-processing is indispensable for efficient FP expression in Laccaria. Nuclear FP localization was obtained via in-frame fusion of FPs between the intron-containing genomic gene sequences of Laccaria histone H2B, while cytosolic FP expression was produced by incorporating the intron-containing 5' fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoding gene. In addition, we have characterized the consensus Kozak sequence of strongly expressed genes in Laccaria and demonstrated its boosting effect on transgene mRNA accumulation. Based on these results, an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation compatible plasmid set was designed for easy use of FPs in Laccaria. The four cloning plasmids presented here allow fast and highly flexible construction of C-terminal in-frame fusions between the sequences of interest and the two FPs, expressed either from the endogenous gene promoter, allowing thus evaluation of the native regulation modes of the gene under study, or alternatively, from the constitutive Agaricus bisporus gpdII promoter for enhanced cellular protein localization assays. The molecular tools described here for cell-biological studies in Laccaria can also be exploited in studies of other biotrophic or saprotrophic basidiomycete species susceptible to genetic transformation.</em></small><br>[ID: 32170354]"

Chitin synthase (CHS), chitinase (CHIT) and autophagy (ATG) genes have been associated to stress response preceding the formation of basidiocarp. An analysis of literature mining, interactomics and gene expression was developed to identify the main proteins related to development, cell wall organization and autophagy in M. perniciosa. TORC2 complex elements were identified and were involved in the response to the nutrient starvation during the fungus development stages preceding the basidiocarp formation. This complex interacted with target proteins related to cell wall synthesis and to polarization and cell division (FKS1, CHS, CDC42, ROM2). Autolysis and autophagy processes were associated to CHIT2, ATG8 and to the TORC1 complex (TOR1 and KOG1), which is central in the upstream signalization of the stress response due to nutrient starvation and growth regulation. Other important elements that participate to steps preceding basidiocarp formation were also identified (KOG1, SSZ1, GDI1, FKS1, CCD10, CKS1, CDC42, RHO1, AVO1, BAG7). Similar gene expression patterns during fungus reproductive structure formation and when treated by rapamycin (a nutritional related-autophagy stress agent) were observed: cell division related-genes were repressed while those related to autolysis/autophagy were overexpressed.</em></small><br>[ID: 32194118]"

Heinzelmann R, Rigling D, Sipos G, Münsterkötter M, Croll D<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Recombination shapes the evolutionary trajectory of populations and plays an important role in the faithful transmission of chromosomes during meiosis. Levels of sexual reproduction and recombination are important properties of host-pathogen interactions because the speed of antagonistic co-evolution depends on the ability of hosts and pathogens to generate genetic variation. However, our understanding of the importance of recombination is limited because large taxonomic groups remain poorly investigated. Here, we analyze recombination rate variation in the basidiomycete fungus Armillaria ostoyae, which is an aggressive pathogen on a broad range of conifers and other trees. We analyzed a previously constructed, dense genetic map based on 198 single basidiospore progeny from a cross. Progeny were genotyped at a genome-wide set of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing. Based on a linkage map of on 11,700 SNPs spanning 1007.5 cM, we assembled genomic scaffolds into 11 putative chromosomes of a total genome size of 56.6 Mb. We identified 1984 crossover events among all progeny and found that recombination rates were highly variable along chromosomes. Recombination hotspots tended to be in regions close to the telomeres and were more gene-poor than the genomic background. Genes in proximity to recombination hotspots were encoding on average shorter proteins and were enriched for pectin degrading enzymes. Our analyses enable more powerful population and genome-scale studies of a major tree pathogen.</em></small><br>[ID: 32203246]"

In a previous study, it was also found to have a moderately high per-generation mutation rate of 2×10-8, likely contributing to its high polymorphism. However, this rate has been measured only in an experiment on Petri dishes, and it is unclear how it translates to natural populations. Here, we used an experimental design that measures the rate of accumulation of de novo mutations in a linearly growing mycelium. We show that S. commune accumulates mutations at a rate of 1.24×10-7 substitutions per nucleotide per meter of growth, or ∼2.04×10-11 per nucleotide per cell division. In contrast to what has been observed in a number of species with extensive vegetative growth, this rate does not decline in the course of propagation of a mycelium. As a result, even a moderate per-cell-division mutation rate in S. commune can translate into a very high per-generation mutation rate when the number of cell divisions between consecutive meiosis is large.</em></small><br>[ID: 32243532]"

Arredondo-Santoyo M, Herrera-Camacho J, Vázquez-Garcidueñas MS, Vázquez-Marrufo G<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Fungi can improve stover digestibility due to their ability to secrete oxidative enzymes that depolymerize lignin, allowing the rumen microorganisms to access the polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Some ascomycetes have shown good delignification capability; however, they have been scarcely evaluated for their ability to improve corn stover (CS) ruminal digestibility. We evaluated the laccase induction by CS of the CMU-196 strain of the ascomycete fungus Didymosphaeria sp. (syn. = Paraconiothyrium sp.). Also, we analyzed the capacity of such strain to modify the cell wall of CS and to improve its digestion by the ruminal microbiota. The CMU-196 strain showed a maximum extracellular laccase activity of 39.74 ± 0.24 U/L when an aqueous stover extract (SE, 10% v/v) was added to the growth medium. The addition of ground stover (GS, 2% w/v) increased the activity to a maximum of 262.27 ± 0.58 U/L. In solid-state fermentation (SSF) assays of GS, the strain degrades cell walls, destabilizing the vessels and tracheids of plant biomass; the protein content reaches a maximum of 33.2 g/kg dry matter (DM) at 70 days, while the crude fiber content shows the highest level of 314 g/kg DM at 14 days. SSF treatment of the CS increased the in vitro ruminal production of gas in a fraction that was considered nondigestible at 18 h, and gas production increased by 14% with respect to the untreated GS at 14 days.

Rauschert from soils within a geothermal feature of Yellowstone National Park. Pisolithus arhizus is unique in that it forms closed fruiting bodies that sequester visible sulfur within. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis demonstrates that the P. arhizus fruiting body also concentrates copper, manganese, nickel, and zinc and contains pure granular silica. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis indicates an environment rich in hydrocarbons. Oxygen probe analysis reveals that zones of up to 4× atmospheric oxygen exist within nanometers of zones of near anoxia. Analysis of microbial community structure using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods shows that the fruiting body supports a microbiome that reflects the physiochemical environment of the fruiting body. Diversity and richness measures indicate a microbiome that is significantly richer and more diverse than that of the soils in which P. arhizus grows. Further, P. arhizus sporocarps are enriched significantly in Proteobacteria (primarily Burkholderia) Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Nitrospirae, Elusimicrobia, and Latescibacteria (WS3) while soils are enriched in Actinobacteria (primarily Mycobacterium), Dormibacteraeota (AD3), and Eremiobacteraeota (WPS-2). Finally, pairwise % similarity comparisons indicate that P. arhizus harbors two lineages that may represent new groups in the candidate phylum radiation (CPR). Together, these results demonstrate that P. arhizus provides a novel environment for microbiome studies and provides for interesting hypotheses regarding the evolution, origins, and functions of symbioses and novel microbes.</em></small><br>[ID: 32478485]"

Flammulina velutipes is a common basidiomycete mushroom rich in ergothioneine (EGT). However, the biosynthetic pathway of EGT in F. velutipes is still unclear. In this study, the F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthetic gene 1 (Fvegtl), F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthetic gene 2 (Fvegt2), and F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthetic gene 3 (Fvegt3) were cloned and expressed, and the activities of the proteins encoded by these three genes (FvEgt1, F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthase 1; FvEgt2, F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthase 2; and FvEgt3, F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthase 3) were identified. The results showed that FvEgtl not only has the function of methyltransferase, but also has the function of hercynlcysteineteine sulfoxide (Hersul) synthase, which can catalyze the production of Hersul from histidine and cysteine in F. velutipes. FvEgt2 and FvEgt3 are two functionally different cysteine desulfurase enzymes. Among them, FvEgt2 is a cysteine-cysteine desulfurase-which catalyzes the activation of the S-H bond on cysteine, while FvEgt3 is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent cysteine desulfurase responsible for catalyzing the production of ketimine complex. Our results show that FvEgt1/FvEgt2/FvEgt3 can simultaneously catalyze the production of EGT by histidine, cysteine, and pyridoxal phosphate. Collectively, the in vitro synthesis of EGT in the edible fungus F. velutipes was first achieved, which laid the foundation for the biological production of EGT.</em></small><br>[ID: 32479005]"

This fungus is widely used to study fruiting body formation and development. Molecular mechanisms controlling its growth from vegetative mycelium to multicellular mature fruiting body have been studied extensively. However, little is known about the underlying biological processes during germ tube outgrowth or the transition from basidiospores to multinucleate hyphae. To better understand sexual spore germination in fungi, here we examined the time-dependent cellular events at resting, germinating and fully germinated basidiospores of C. cinerea by genome-wide transcriptional and post-transcriptional analyses and by carbohydrate composition analysis. Our results revealed a high demand of protein degradation, and biosynthesis of various compounds at the early stage of basidiospore gemination and dynamic changes of carbohydrate metabolism throughout the germination process. Seven microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) were identified in the resting basidiospores of C. cinerea, six of which were basidiospore-specific. Glycogen and trehalose were shown to be the carbon sources supporting the initiation of germ tube outgrowth. One basidiospore-specific milRNA, cci-milR-37, was found to be a potential regulator of glycogen metabolic pathways related to vegetative hyphal growth. Our results demonstrated the mRNA and miRNA-mediated regulation on energy production, protein and carbohydrate metabolisms at the early developmental stages of germ tube to form totipotent hyphae. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the roles of miRNAs in mushroom basidiospore germination and out-growth.</em></small><br>[ID: 32522620]"

Ghirardo A, Fochi V, Lange B, Witting M, Schnitzler JP, Perotto S, Balestrini R<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>All orchids rely on mycorrhizal fungi for organic carbon, at least during early development. In fact, orchid seed germination leads to the formation of a protocorm, a heterotrophic postembryonic structure colonized by intracellular fungal coils, thought to be the site of nutrient transfer. The molecular mechanisms underlying mycorrhizal interactions and metabolic changes induced by this symbiosis in both partners remain mostly unknown. We studied plant-fungus interactions in the mycorrhizal association between the Mediterranean orchid Serapias vomeracea and the basidiomycete Tulasnella calospora using nontargeted metabolomics. Plant and fungal metabolomes obtained from symbiotic structures were compared with those obtained under asymbiotic conditions. Symbiosis induced substantial metabolomic alterations in both partners. In particular, structural and signaling lipid compounds increased markedly in the external fungal mycelium growing near the symbiotic protocorms, whereas chito-oligosaccharides were identified uniquely in symbiotic protocorms. This work represents the first description of metabolic changes occurring in orchid mycorrhiza. These results - combined with previous transcriptomic data - provide novel insights on the mechanisms underlying the orchid mycorrhizal association and open intriguing questions on the role of fungal lipids in this symbiosis.</em></small><br>[ID: 32668507]"

DeMarco AG, Milholland KL, Pendleton AL, Whitney JJ, Zhu P, Wesenberg DT, Nambiar M, Pepe A, Paula S, Chmielewski J, Wisecaver JH, Tao WA, Hall MC<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Cdc14 protein phosphatases play an important role in plant infection by several fungal pathogens. This and other properties of Cdc14 enzymes make them an intriguing target for development of new antifungal crop treatments. Active site architecture and substrate specificity of Cdc14 from the model fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScCdc14) are well-defined and unique among characterized phosphatases. Cdc14 appears absent from some model plants. However, the extent of conservation of Cdc14 sequence, structure, and specificity in fungal plant pathogens is unknown. We addressed this by performing a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the Cdc14 family and comparing the conservation of active site structure and specificity among a sampling of plant pathogen Cdc14 homologs. We show that Cdc14 was lost in the common ancestor of angiosperm plants but is ubiquitous in ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. The unique substrate specificity of ScCdc14 was invariant in homologs from eight diverse species of dikarya, suggesting it is conserved across the lineage. A synthetic substrate mimetic inhibited diverse fungal Cdc14 homologs with similar low µM K</em></small><br>[ID: 32694511]"

Rueda AM, López de Los Santos Y, Vincent AT, Létourneau M, Hernández I, Sánchez CI, Molina V D, Ospina SA, Veyrier FJ, Doucet N<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The pretreatment of biomass remains a critical requirement for bio-renewable fuel production from lignocellulose. Although current processes primarily involve chemical and physical approaches, the biological breakdown of lignin using enzymes and microorganisms is quickly becoming an interesting eco-friendly alternative to classical processes. As a result, bioprospection of wild fungi from naturally occurring lignin-rich sources remains a suitable method to uncover and isolate new species exhibiting ligninolytic activity. In this study, wild species of white rot fungi were collected from Colombian forests based on their natural wood decay ability and high capacity to secrete oxidoreductases with high affinity for phenolic polymers such as lignin. Based on high activity obtained from solid-state fermentation using a lignocellulose source from oil palm as matrix, we describe the isolation and whole-genome sequencing of Dictyopanus pusillus, a wild basidiomycete fungus exhibiting ABTS oxidation as an indication of laccase activity. Functional characterization of a crude enzymatic extract identified laccase activity as the main enzymatic contributor to fungal extracts, an observation supported by the identification of 13 putative genes encoding for homologous laccases in the genome. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report of an enzymatic extract exhibiting laccase activity in the Dictyopanus genera, offering means to exploit this species and its enzymes for the delignification process of lignocellulosic by-products from oil palm.</em></small><br>[ID: 32730337]"

Qin D, Xu T, Liu T, Chen W, Gao L<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Wheat common bunt is a serious disease that may lead to yield losses of 75-80% in many wheat regions of the world (Mathre 1996). The disease may reduce yield and flour quality by producing trimethylamine, a compound that smells like rotting fish (Castlebury et al. 2005; Hoffmann 1981; Mathre 1996). Two closely related basidiomycete species, Tilletia caries (DC.) Tul. & C. Tul. [syn. T. tritici (Bjerk.) Wint.] and T. laevis J. G. Kühn [syn. T. foetida (Wallr.) Liro], cause wheat common bunt. Teliospore morphology is used to differentiate the two species. Teliospores of T. caries have reticulates on the surface while teliospores of T. laevis have a smooth surface (Pieczul et al. 2018). T. laevis was reported in Liaoning, Shaanxi, Shandong, Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Gansu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet (Guo 2011; Wang 1963), but not in Henan, the biggest wheat production province in China, before the present study. In July 2019, we found wheat common bunt in three fields grown with cultivar Zhengmai 618 in Yugong Mountain, Henan province. The diseased wheat heads had bunt balls filled with black powder with fishy smell. The disease incidences in these fields were 20-50%, but no common bunt was found in other nearby fields. About 200 diseased heads were sampled from the three fields. Teliospores from each head were observed under a microscope, and they all had smooth surface. Observations using a scanning electron microscope also showed smooth-surfaced teliospores. Teliospores were measured 13.5 to 18.5 μm in diameter. After surface sterilization of diseased heads using 0.25% NaClO for 5 min, teliospore suspension (1×106/ml) was made using sterilized distilled water and spread on water agar (200 μl per plate), and the plates were kept at 15°C with 24 h light (Goates and Hoffman 1987). On the 6th days, teliospores were germinated. Based on the disease symptoms, teliospore morphology, and germination, the bunt fungus was identified as T. laevis. To fulfill Koch's postulates, 1 ml of germinating teliospore suspension at the concentration of 106 spores/ml was injected into the heads of susceptible wheat cultivar (Dongxuan 3) at the boot stage with a syringe, and the plants injected with sterile ddH2O were used as control. The inoculated plants were grown in a growth chamber at 17°C with 50% humidity and 24 h light (300 μmol/m2/s). After one month at the ripening stage, the kernels of the inoculated plants were filled with black teliospores releasing fishy smell, and the control plants did not have bunt heads. Under a scanning electron microscope, teliospores from the inoculated heads had smooth surface and were measured 13.5 to 18.5 μm in diameter, similar to the teliospores of bunt heads from the fields. The fungus was also confirmed through molecular characterization using sequence characterized amplification region (SCAR) markers specific for T. laevis, and the expected 660 bp (Yao et al., 2019) and 286 bp (Zhang et al. 2012) bands were obtained separately from the teliospore samples from both the fields and growth chamber. The collection named as CGMCC 3.20112 was deposited in China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of T. laevis causing wheat common bunt in Henan Province of China. Because the pathogen is seedborne and soilborne, the disease may become a high risk to wheat production in Henan and other provinces of China.</em></small><br>[ID: 32779542]"

Wang A, Zha Z, Yin D, Shu X, Ma L, Wang L, Li P, Zheng A<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Rice kernel smut (RKS), caused by the basidiomycete fungus Tilletia horrida, is one of the most devastating diseases affecting the production of male sterile lines of rice (Oryza sativa) worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms of resistance to T. horrida have not yet been explored. In the present study, RNA sequencing analysis of rice male sterile lines, that are resistant and susceptible to RKS (Jiangcheng 3A and 9311A, respectively) was conducted after T. horrida infection. Transcriptomic analysis showed that a greater number of differentially expressed gene (DEGs) was observed in Jiangcheng 3A compared with 9311A after T. horrida inoculation. Furthermore, 4, 425 DEGs were uniquely detected in Jiangcheng 3A, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of these DEGs revealed that oxidoreductase activity, peroxidase activity, cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis were key pathways for T. horrida resistance. In summary and based on transcriptome analysis, we suggest a preliminary regulatory mechanism for Jiangcheng 3A cultivar resistance response to T. horrida inoculation.</em></small><br>[ID: 32966859]"
