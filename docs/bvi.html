        <h1>Case Study: What is driving my NAV?</h1>
        <p>BizCo, a company dedicated to managing venture capital investments, is recently having some issues. Following the exit of all the members of the Executive Committee (ExCo), who left the company to join KKR, the Board of Directors (BoD) of BizCo appointed a new ExCo composed of Santi, Ainhoa, and Unai. It is January 10th, 2025.</p>
        <p>The BoD needs to understand the dynamics of the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the portfolio, how this NAV evolved during 2024, and see if there are some estimates on what the NAV of the portfolio might look like as of the end of 2024 and as of today. In addition to this, it is key to understand what the underlying drivers are that explain the NAV and Money On Invested Capital (MOIC) dynamics of the portfolio, and the different clusters explaining it.</p>
        <p>The ExCo is new to the role and needs to carry out this analysis for the meeting scheduled with the BoD on Friday 24th, 2025. The ExCo calls you, with a background in Data Analysis, to help them out with this task and provides you with a spreadsheet with the information of the portfolio at the portfolio company level (see attached) and some public market data.</p>
        <p>The spreadsheet has different qualitative fields (e.g., report date, report currency, manager, fund, vertical, company name, technology, business model, investment status, round, current round, investment instrument) and quantitative fields (e.g., #shares, Last Price / Share, NAV, Investment). The info is at the investment level, so there might be many investments carried out on the same company at different points in time and valuations. Also, there are some listed companies on public markets among the portfolio companies.</p>
        <p>You need to decide the type of analysis and outputs you will build in order to meet the needs of BizCoâ€™s BoD. You are free to ask as many questions as required, that will be responded to at least on a daily basis by the ExCo.</p>
        <p>The ExCo will arrange a meeting with you on Wednesday 22nd or Thursday 23rd, where you will be presenting how you developed the analysis, the main conclusions of it, and the outputs generated.</p>
        <p>Go for it!!!</p>

                <p>The chart illustrates the overall NAV (Net Asset Value) metrics, specifically <strong>Investment EUR</strong> and <strong>PnL EUR</strong>, categorized by continent. Key conclusions are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>North America Dominance:</strong> North America significantly leads in both Investment EUR and PnL EUR, surpassing all other continents combined. This indicates a major concentration of investment and profitability in this region.</li>
                    <li><strong>LATAM and Rest of Europe:</strong> LATAM shows a moderate level of both investment and profitability, while Rest of Europe has lower levels but still surpasses APAC.</li>
                    <li><strong>APAC Performance:</strong> APAC has the smallest values for both metrics, indicating lower investment and profitability compared to other regions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This distribution highlights the regional imbalance in investments and returns, with North America being the dominant player, while other regions, particularly APAC, exhibit smaller contributions to the overall NAV.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stable Performance:</strong> Across all quarters (4Q23, 1Q24, 2Q24, 3Q24), both Investment EUR and PnL EUR remain relatively consistent, showing stability in NAV metrics over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peak in 1Q24:</strong> The highest combined value of Investment EUR and PnL EUR is observed in 1Q24, indicating a slight uptick in performance compared to other quarters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proportion Consistency:</strong> The proportion of PnL EUR to Investment EUR remains similar across all quarters, signifying balanced performance trends.</li>

                <h2>NAV by Investment Type</h2>
                <p>The chart illustrates NAV (Net Asset Value) based on investment types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Investment</strong> and <strong>Follow On</strong> represent the majority of the NAV, with both investment and PnL values being significantly higher than other categories.</li>
                    <li>Other categories, such as <strong>Primary</strong>, <strong>Primary and Secondary</strong>, and <strong>Secondary</strong>, have minimal contributions to the overall NAV.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This indicates that the majority of investments and profitability are concentrated in initial and follow-on investments.</p>

                <h2>NAV by Investment Instrument</h2>
                <p>The chart highlights the distribution of NAV by investment instruments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Equity</strong> and <strong>Equity + Convertible Bond</strong> dominate the NAV, contributing the highest amounts to both investment and PnL metrics.</li>
                    <li>Other instruments, such as <strong>Convertible Bonds</strong> and <strong>Listed Companies</strong>, show modest contributions, while categories like <strong>Preferred Equity</strong> and <strong>SAFE</strong> have negligible impact.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The emphasis on equity-based instruments underlines the strategic focus on these investment types.</p>

                <h2>NAV by Fund</h2>
                <p>This chart categorizes NAV based on individual funds:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Funds like <strong>Gospel Legacy Portfolio</strong> and <strong>Gospel XYZ I</strong> demonstrate the largest NAV values, far exceeding other funds.</li>
                    <li>Most other funds, such as <strong>Swanlab Fund Tech</strong> or <strong>Towercarbon 781</strong>, contribute minimally to the overall NAV.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This indicates a heavy reliance on a few key funds to drive investment and profitability performance.</p>

                <h2>NAV by Sector</h2>
                <p>The chart represents NAV by sector allocation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Financial Services</strong> (including Fintech, Insurtech, Crypto) overwhelmingly contributes the largest NAV values for both investment and PnL metrics.</li>
                    <li>Other sectors, such as <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>, <strong>Healthtech</strong>, and <strong>Agritech</strong>, have minor contributions, with most sectors having negligible impact.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The focus on financial services highlights the priority sector for investments and profitability.</p>

                <p>Overall, these charts reflect a concentrated strategy with dominance in equity-based instruments, reliance on key funds, and a heavy emphasis on financial services as the primary sector of investment.</p>

                <h2>Distribution of Investment Differences (EUR)</h2>
                <p>The chart visualizes the distribution of investment differences across quarters:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The majority of the differences are clustered close to the 0 EUR line, indicating minor fluctuations in investment values for most data points.</li>
                    <li>There are a few outliers, with differences exceeding Â±5M EUR, and a notable extreme outlier below -10M EUR.</li>
                    <li>Consistency is observed across quarters (4Q23 to 3Q24), with no significant shifts in the pattern of investment differences.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This indicates relatively stable investment differences, with occasional large deviations likely attributable to specific cases.</p>

                <h2>Distribution of NAV Differences (EUR)</h2>
                <p>The chart displays the distribution of NAV (Net Asset Value) differences across quarters:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Similar to the investment differences, the majority of NAV differences are concentrated near 0 EUR, reflecting minor variations in NAV for most data points.</li>
                    <li>Outliers are more pronounced compared to investment differences, with several exceeding Â±10M EUR and one extreme outlier below -15M EUR.</li>
                    <li>The pattern remains consistent across all quarters (4Q23 to 3Q24), with no significant changes in the overall distribution of differences.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The results suggest stable NAV trends with occasional large deviations, possibly tied to unique events or adjustments.</p>

                <p>Overall, both charts indicate a stable distribution of investment and NAV differences, with occasional outliers requiring further analysis to understand their causes.</p>

    <h2>Sector Investment Distribution</h2>
    <p>The chart highlights the distribution of investments across different sectors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial Services</strong> is the largest sector, receiving the majority of investments, far surpassing other sectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Services</strong> and <strong>Energy</strong> follow as significant contributors but remain well behind Financial Services.</li>
        <li>Sectors such as <strong>Climate Software</strong>, <strong>Agritech</strong>, and <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> receive minimal investments, indicating lesser priority.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data reflects a focus on Financial Services as the primary driver of investments, with other sectors receiving relatively lower emphasis.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Fund Distribution</h2>
    <p>The chart shows the allocation of investments across vertical fund categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decarbonization</strong> and <strong>Growth</strong> funds dominate the distribution, with almost equal and significantly high allocations.</li>
        <li><strong>FinTech</strong> and <strong>Other</strong> funds receive comparatively lower investments, indicating a secondary focus on these verticals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The emphasis on Decarbonization and Growth funds reflects strategic priorities for addressing climate goals and fostering expansion.</p>

    <h2>Management Distribution</h2>
    <p>This chart illustrates the distribution of investments across different management entities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Towercarbon</strong> is the largest recipient of investments, significantly exceeding all other entities.</li>
        <li>Other notable management entities include <strong>Gospel</strong>, <strong>Platonic Growth</strong>, and <strong>Saigon Partners</strong>, but their allocations are much smaller compared to Towercarbon.</li>
        <li>Smaller entities, such as <strong>Swanlab</strong> and <strong>SeaWood</strong>, receive minimal allocations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The results highlight the concentration of investments with a few key management entities, particularly Towercarbon.</p>

    <p>Overall, the data reveals a focus on specific sectors, vertical funds, and management entities, reflecting targeted investment strategies.</p>
