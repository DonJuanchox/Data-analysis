        <h1>Case Study: What is driving my NAV?</h1>
        <p>BizCo, a company dedicated to managing venture capital investments, is recently having some issues. Following the exit of all the members of the Executive Committee (ExCo), who left the company to join KKR, the Board of Directors (BoD) of BizCo appointed a new ExCo composed of Santi, Ainhoa, and Unai. It is January 10th, 2025.</p>
        <p>The BoD needs to understand the dynamics of the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the portfolio, how this NAV evolved during 2024, and see if there are some estimates on what the NAV of the portfolio might look like as of the end of 2024 and as of today. In addition to this, it is key to understand what the underlying drivers are that explain the NAV and Money On Invested Capital (MOIC) dynamics of the portfolio, and the different clusters explaining it.</p>
        <p>The ExCo is new to the role and needs to carry out this analysis for the meeting scheduled with the BoD on Friday 24th, 2025. The ExCo calls you, with a background in Data Analysis, to help them out with this task and provides you with a spreadsheet with the information of the portfolio at the portfolio company level (see attached) and some public market data.</p>
        <p>The spreadsheet has different qualitative fields (e.g., report date, report currency, manager, fund, vertical, company name, technology, business model, investment status, round, current round, investment instrument) and quantitative fields (e.g., #shares, Last Price / Share, NAV, Investment). The info is at the investment level, so there might be many investments carried out on the same company at different points in time and valuations. Also, there are some listed companies on public markets among the portfolio companies.</p>
        <p>You need to decide the type of analysis and outputs you will build in order to meet the needs of BizCoâ€™s BoD. You are free to ask as many questions as required, that will be responded to at least on a daily basis by the ExCo.</p>
        <p>The ExCo will arrange a meeting with you on Wednesday 22nd or Thursday 23rd, where you will be presenting how you developed the analysis, the main conclusions of it, and the outputs generated.</p>
        <p>Go for it!!!</p>

            <strong>Brazil</strong> anchors <strong>South America</strong> with exceptional performance, recording <strong>â‚¬64.88M</strong> in investments, <strong>â‚¬27.93M</strong> in PnL, and a NAV of <strong>â‚¬92.81M</strong>. With <strong>35 unique investments</strong>, Brazil underscores its position as a growing and vibrant market for venture capital. Other countries in the region, like <strong>Colombia</strong> and <strong>Chile</strong>, contribute more modestly, with investments of <strong>â‚¬0.24M</strong> and <strong>â‚¬0.44M</strong>, respectively. Although these amounts are smaller, South America continues to be a region of significance, driven by Brazil's strong performance and potential.

        <h2>Israel</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Israel</strong> emerges as an outlier with its unique and challenging position in the portfolio. Despite a substantial investment of <strong>â‚¬81.19M</strong>, Israel reports a concerning <strong>-â‚¬76.91M PnL</strong>, making it the only country in the portfolio with a negative PnL. Its total NAV of <strong>â‚¬4.27M</strong> remains overshadowed by this stark underperformance. This anomaly calls for a deeper analysis to identify the factors contributing to such a result and reassess strategies in this market. Israel's negative PnL stands out distinctly on the map, emphasizing the need for strategic intervention.

        <h1>NAV Metric Remarks per Quarter</h1>
    <h2>Investment and PnL</h2>
    <p>
        The chart provides a comparative analysis of <strong>Investment EUR</strong> and <strong>PnL EUR</strong> across four quarters, demonstrating consistent performance over time. 
        In <strong>4Q23</strong>, investments amounted to slightly above <strong>400M EUR</strong>, while profits reached just under <strong>500M EUR</strong>. 
        Moving to <strong>1Q24</strong>, a noticeable increase in both investments and profits can be observed, with investments climbing to approximately <strong>450M EUR</strong> and profits exceeding <strong>500M EUR</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        During <strong>2Q24</strong>, investment levels remained steady, matching those of <strong>1Q24</strong>, while PnL showed a slight decline, though still above <strong>500M EUR</strong>. 
        Finally, in <strong>3Q24</strong>, a minor decrease in both investments and profits is evident, with profits remaining robust near <strong>500M EUR</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Companies</h2>
    <p>
        Companies such as <strong>Sumup</strong>, <strong>Guideline</strong>, and <strong>Neon</strong> consistently dominate NAV weight, collectively accounting for over <strong>60%</strong> of the portfolio in most quarters. Smaller companies under "Other" also make up a significant share.
    </p>
    <h2>Investment Rounds</h2>
    <p>
        This chart illustrates the <strong>NAV distribution</strong> across various funding rounds over four quarters. The <strong>Series A</strong>, <strong>Series B</strong>, and <strong>Series C</strong> rounds clearly dominate the NAV weight consistently throughout all observed quarters. These rounds together represent the majority of NAV allocation, highlighting a strong emphasis on early to mid-stage investments.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Seed Stage</strong> and <strong>Series D</strong> rounds also make noticeable contributions, albeit smaller than the leading rounds. These contributions indicate a balanced strategy that includes investments in early and more mature stages of funding.
    </p>
    <h2>Funds</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Gospel US Fund</strong> contributes the largest NAV weight, consistently over <strong>30%</strong>, followed by the <strong>Gospel Global Fund</strong>, which contributes over <strong>25%</strong>. Other funds like the <strong>Gospel Brazil Fund (SPV)</strong> and <strong>Artemis BAVP</strong> make smaller contributions, typically below <strong>10%</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Sector</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Financial Services</strong> maintain the highest NAV weight, consistently over <strong>50%</strong> across quarters. <strong>Business Services</strong> and <strong>Energy</strong> are the next largest contributors, each maintaining <strong>15-20% NAV weight</strong>. Sectors like <strong>Logistics & Mobility</strong> and <strong>Carbon Capture & Carbon Markets</strong> remain underrepresented, contributing less than <strong>5%</strong>.

            <h1>Investment and NAV Differences</h1>
            <h2>Distribution of Investment Differences (EUR)</h2>
   <p>
         The <strong> majority</strong> of investment differences cluster tightly around the <strong>0 EUR</strong> mark, indicating that most calculated investment values align closely with reported values.
         However, </strong> there are notable outliers exceeding <strong>Â±5M EUR</strong>, with a few extreme cases surpassing <strong>-10M EUR</strong>. These outliers could represent discrepancies in valuation calculations or reporting.
    </p>
    <h2>Distribution of NAV Differences (EUR)</h2>
    <p>
        Similar to investment differences, the <strong>majority</strong> of NAV differences also cluster around <strong>0 EUR</strong>, reflecting alignment between reported and calculated NAV values for most portfolio items.
        However, the presence of more pronounced outliers compared to investment differences is evident. Several points exceed <strong>Â±10M EUR</strong>, and a few fall below <strong>-15M EUR</strong>, signaling significant mismatches in NAV calculations or external factors affecting valuation.
