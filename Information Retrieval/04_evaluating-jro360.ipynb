    "**Answer:** It is quite interesting as the Kappa score was higher for PubMed than Scholar Google, hence we had the idea that PubMed was retrieving more relevant documents to the users, however using Precision we can see that the scores from Scholar Google are 0.1 better in both lists. Hence, we need to decided which evaluation to consider either the agreement between users or the the ratio of true positives out of all retrieved documents. Personally, as far as I understood the lecture, I would prefer Cohen's Kappa as it takes out the agreement by chance while precision it does not. Furthermore, those precision values do not take into account the results of the other user which might explain why precision values are higher for Scholar Google than for PubMed."
